On Thursday, 10 December, negotiations continued on the draft Paris outcome. Following all night consultations, parties continued meeting bilaterally while waiting for the revised draft Paris outcome text.
In the afternoon, the open-ended group of legal and linguistic experts conducting the review of the paragraphs of the draft agreement forwarded by the Comité de Paris convened.
The COP plenary considered agenda items and adopted decisions on organizational matters, matters related to finance and capacity building, and the reports of the subsidiary bodies, the Adaptation Committee, and the TEC and CTCN, among other items.
The CMP plenary considered agenda items and adopted decisions, including on: organizational matters; issues related to the CDM and JI; and the report of the high-level ministerial on increased ambition of Kyoto Protocol commitments.
A revised draft Paris outcome text was presented in the Comité de Paris at 9:00pm, which then closed to allow for consultations by parties. An “indaba of solutions” then convened throughout the night to address all remaining unresolved items in the text.
COMITÉ DE PARIS 
In the evening, COP 21 President Laurent Fabius reported that the previous night’s indaba and parallel consultation had made progress, and that, throughout the day on Thursday, 10 December, delegations remained in contact in an effort to find compromises. He added that the COP 21 Presidency continued to gather the opinions of groups and parties.
Asking the Secretariat to distribute the new text, COP 21 President Fabius said parties would have approximately two hours to study it, and explained that the new text contained a range of choices for the purpose of reaching balance, impartiality and reconciling differences.
Noting some brackets remained, he said that there are “open options” on the most complex issues of differentiation, finance and ambition. He asked delegates to examine the document with “a new perspective,” keeping the final agreement in mind, suggesting “we are extremely close to the finish line.”
He announced he would convene an “indaba of solutions” directed at compromise, not general statements, at 11:30pm. He further proposed that if difficulty arises on a particular point, he would invite a facilitator to meet “in a corner” or another room with interested heads of delegation with the aim of coming back with a compromise within 30-40 minutes, to then be presented in the indaba. He indicated the progress achieved would be presented in the “final text” on Friday, 11 December.

IN THE CORRIDORS 
Thursday morning dawned with reports that the previous night’s indaba and informal consultations had lasted until dawn. The few exhausted high-level delegates that were to be found in the hallways of Le Bourget gave mixed reports on progress in the informals.
Some seemed rather pessimistic, perhaps magnified by the lack of sleep, reporting on “very limited movement” on the key political issues and saying that parties had spent much of their time reading statements reiterating long-held positions. Another said that, perhaps, “just enough flexibility” had been shown to enable compromises to start materializing.
Those in the venue remained in limbo throughout the day, waiting impatiently for the “penultimate” draft text, as foreseen by COP 21 President Laurent Fabius on Wednesday evening. Others clustered informally to continue hashing out language to bridge various parties’ proposals, in preparation for the final push towards an agreement expected by some as early as Thursday night.
The wait was longer than anticipated, with Thursday’s Comité meeting being postponed twice, first from 3:00pm to 7:00pm, and then finally to 9:00pm. Throughout the day, delegates continued stressing that differentiation, finance and ambition remained the outstanding issues, a fact confirmed in the evening meetings of the Comité, where COP 21 President Laurent Fabius observed that these issues remained bracketed in the new text.
With the finish line in sight, the COP Presidency and the Secretariat seemed to be aiming to leave as little as possible to chance. Several delegates reported “unprecedented” personal attention by the French Presidency to engage parties’ raising concerns in plenary and ensure their issues were addressed. One reported that the very highest levels were throwing all of their effort into smoothing the path towards agreement, with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon engaging in bilaterals with parties on key issues. As was to be expected, ministerial engagement ramped up as well, with a number of countries holding their own bilaterals.
Around the venue’s cafeterias, several delegations expressed concern over the rapid pace of negotiations and the large number of bilaterals and consultations, saying these were overwhelming for small delegations while also noting that precious negotiation time was quickly ticking away. One committed, but exhausted, delegate quipped during the COP plenary, “I won’t use the word disorganized, but we now find ourselves in a dynamic process that makes attending to all remaining issues difficult.” Nevertheless, as the meeting turned nocturnal, after a long day of waiting and with a long night of negotiation ahead, another delegate reminded the weary, “there is just too much at stake to fail.”

OPENING STATEMENTS: A number of speakers commented on technology, adaptation and financial matters. The G-77/CHINA highlighted the fourth review of the financial mechanism and requested an update on operationalization of the Adaptation Fund. He expressed disappointment with the GEF's strategic programme on investment for technology transfer, and urged a renewed mandate for the Consultative Group of Experts on non-Annex I National Communications (CGE). The AFRICAN GROUP opposed proposals to provide loan financing, as opposed to grants, to developing countries. Maldives, for LDCs, complained of funding delays for implementing NAPAs. COLOMBIA proposed extending the levy on the CDM for adaptation to the other mechanisms.
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER: The Secretariat introduced documents (FCCC/SBI/2008/5 & 7, MISC.1, and INF.1). EGTT Chair Jukka Uosukainen reported on the EGTT’s work. Richard Hosier, GEF, reported on a strategic programme to scale up technology transfer investment, noting that the GEF Council could not agree on a draft programme for consideration in Bonn. The EU and JAPAN welcomed the GEF’s report, while the G-77/CHINA said the report deviates from the Bali mandate. A joint SBI and SBSTA contact group was established to consider the EGTT's work programme, co-chaired by Holger Liptow (Germany) and Carlos Fuller (Belize). Another contact group, co-chaired by Philip Gwage (Uganda) and Holger Liptow (Germany), will consider technology transfer under SBI.

NAIROBI WORK PROGRAMME (NWP): On the NWP (FCCC/SBSTA/2008/2-5, MISC.3 & Adds.1-2), the US stressed the importance of improving parties’ oversight of calls for action and action pledges. AUSTRALIA welcomed continuity between current and future areas of work and suggested a greater emphasis on the NWP playing a catalytic role in the next phase. The PHILIPPINES noted the lack of observation data in developing countries and proposed a workshop to help fill this gap. JAPAN stressed cost-benefit analysis for adaptation activities. Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) and Donald Lemmen (Canada) will co-chair a contact group.
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER: The Secretariat introduced documents (FCCC/SBSTA/2008/4, INFs.1-2). EGTT Chair Uosukainen reported on the EGTT’s proposed approach to developing and testing candidate performance indicators before making recommendations. Parties welcomed the reconstitution of the EGTT and urged approval of the proposed 2008-09 work programme. JAPAN and others highlighted the importance of the private sector. The EU underscored its €650,000 additional contribution to the EGTT in 2008. CANADA noted upcoming revised technology needs assessment (TNA) guidelines, and the US recommended no further TNAs be funded until the new guidelines become available. SWITZERLAND stressed the importance of ambitious emissions reduction policies to foster technology transfer. A contact group, co-chaired by Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Kunihido Shimada (Japan), was established to prepare draft SBSTA conclusions.
REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM DEFORESTATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: The Secretariat introduced this issue (FCCC/SBSTA/2008/MISC.4 & Adds.1-2). The Democratic Republic of Congo, for the CONGO BASIN COUNTRIES, stated that reference data based on historical trends would penalize past good behavior.

METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES (CONVENTION): Proposal by Brazil: The Secretariat introduced documents (FCCC/SBSTA/2008/MISCs.1 & 5). BRAZIL said this work could inform the post-2012 process, while the US stated that commitments should not be based on historical responsibility. Washington Zhakata (Zimbabwe) will hold informal consultations.
International aviation and maritime emissions: Many non-Annex I parties expressed concern that IMO’s work on a binding instrument on shipping emissions (FCCC/SBSTA/2008/MISC.9) is not guided by the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. The EU, NEW ZEALAND, SINGAPORE, MICRONESIA and others supported IMO’s work. The US said IMO’s decision stems from its own mandate, which precedes the Kyoto Protocol. Plenary discussions will continue on Thursday.

IN THE CORRIDORS
The High-Level Conference on World Food Security taking place in Rome was generating some talk in the corridors in Bonn, with a few delegates drawing connections to the post-2012 discussions, particularly regarding the role of biofuels. “The excitement is all in Rome right now,” said one negotiator, adding that a “greater sense of urgency” might be needed in Bonn to get through the heavy workload.
Some delegates were also talking about financing issues. Several commented on the Adaptation Fund, Resource Allocation Framework, and funding for NAPA implementation – important issues for many developing countries and LDCs. There was also talk about the GEF’s draft strategic programme, and speculation on how some developing country concerns with the financial mechanism might manifest themselves in the coming days.
Looking further ahead, a growing number of participants were expressing concerns about the availability and cost of accommodation for COP 14 and COP/MOP 4 in Poznan, Poland, in December. “I hope I don’t end up sleeping in the snow in December!” said one delegate, seemingly only partly in jest.

On Friday, 4 December, the ADP contact group considered a revised compilation text throughout the day. In the morning and afternoon, informal consultations and contact groups finalized work under the SBs, and a contact group under the COP took place. The SBI and SBSTA closing plenaries took place in the evening.
ADP CONTACT GROUP 
In the morning, ADP Co-Chair Ahmed Djoghlaf invited comments on two documents, a revised draft agreement and decision text on workstreams 1 and 2, “the compilation text,” and a document containing the work of the ADP contact group incorporating bridging proposals by the co-facilitators, “the compilation text with bridging proposals,” both issued on Friday, 4 December, at 10:00am.
South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA, requested time to consult, noting the group’s surprise that the second document contained bridging proposals embedded within the compilation text. Indicating readiness to work with the texts, the EU noted that seeing bridging proposals in a textual context was helpful.
Malaysia, for the LMDCs, underscored the understanding that only the revised draft agreement was to be treated as a working document and that the Secretariat would highlight the bridging proposals in the second document. Co-Chair Djoghlaf then suspended the contact group to allow for groups to consult.
In the afternoon, parties considered the compilation text and the compilation text with bridging proposals. Co-Chair Djoghlaf proposed that parties complete a first reading of the text without spin-off groups, with the aim of creating a shorter but comprehensive document for the ministers.
South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA, supported by many parties, expressed willingness to negotiate on the basis of the compilation text with bridging proposals, and proposed that parties be allowed to insert language where necessary and meet separately to discuss specific proposals.
On purpose/general (Articles 2 and 2bis), Co-Chair Djoghlaf suggested progress was not yet possible. Several parties raised points of order, noting it was only the first reading and parties should be allowed to comment.
After comments on Articles 2 and 2bis and interventions on the mode of work, the Co-Chairs and the COP 21 Presidency consulted on the way forward.
Laurence Tubiana, COP 21 Presidency, highlighted that the compilation text with bridging proposals provides a “good base” and urged parties to focus on producing a text for the COP. Malaysia, for the LMDCs, proposed that parties be allowed to identify key elements of concern that, together with the compilation text with bridging proposals, would be forwarded for negotiations under the COP.
After TUVALU, the US, the EU, VENEZUELA, CUBA and COLOMBIA expressed general support for using the compilation text with bridging proposals in line with the LMDCs’ proposal, parties began indicating key elements of concern.
On mitigation (Article 3), the EU, supported by Colombia, for AILAC, Maldives, for AOSIS, and the US called for clarifying the date for the submission of contributions. NICARAGUA and BOLIVIA called for Mother Earth to be reinserted in the text.
At the end of a preambular paragraph on special needs, EL SALVADOR requested adding “and the Central American isthmus.” In a paragraph on the long-term vision for technology development and transfer (Article 7), MEXICO asked that “socially and environmentally sound technology” be reinserted.
In the evening, parties continued to identify key elements that they wished to be reflected. On mitigation (Article 3), BOLIVIA, with VENEZUELA, urged the inclusion of non-market mechanisms.
On finance (Article 6), Costa Rica, for AILAC, asked for a clear roadmap, including a short-term goal, and balance between mitigation and adaptation. She said that language on vulnerability was being coordinated within the G-77/China.
On purpose (Article 2), VENEZUELA supported “stabilization” of GHG emissions and, with SAUDI ARABIA and PAKISTAN, opposed the inclusion of “decarbonization” and “carbon neutrality.” KYRGYZSTAN asked to include vulnerability of mountains in the preambular section.
TUVALU urged reinsertion of language on loss and damage that preserves the issue as an independent article. CHINA, among others, called for the CMA to determine cycles after 2030.
On adaptation (Article 4), Bolivia, for the G-77/CHINA, asked to include details on a long-term vision and urged avoiding prescriptive language.
The G-77/CHINA said MRV of finance from developed countries is missing in finance (Article 6), and INDIA urged inclusion of such MRV in transparency (Article 9). The AFRICAN GROUP called exclusion of “African countries” from preambular paragraphs on specific needs “a red line.”
Adjourning the meeting, Co-Chair Djoghlaf indicated, and parties agreed, that a reflection note capturing parties’ comments would be provided alongside the compilation text with bridging proposals and that work would resume in the morning, on Saturday, 4 December.
COP 21 
CONTACT GROUPS: Joint Implementation (JI): This contact group, co-chaired by Yaw Osafo (Ghana), met in the morning.

JAPAN stressed the importance of revitalizing JI. SWITZERLAND asked for an analysis on the role of JI beyond 2020, and synergies with other market mechanisms. Parties agreed that the Co-Chairs would prepare a draft decision for consideration at the next contact group meeting.

IN THE CORRIDORS 
Friday morning opened with delegates frantically trying to “digest” the two new documents produced overnight by the ADP Co-Chairs in cooperation with the co-facilitators. Many worried about bridging proposals being incorporated into the compilation text, both for their loss of visibility and the unclear status of this new text.
Tensions ran high in the ADP contact group as the Saturday, 5 December deadline loomed for the ADP to transmit text to the COP. The mode of work for the second week thus became a hotly anticipated question. One delegate speculated that ministers would be asked to chair spin-off groups. Another wondered if ministers should be convened in a roundtable format. An optimistic participant hoped that the transparent process in week one would not be lost in week two.
Indeed, Laurence Tubiana, for the COP Presidency, repeatedly assured the ADP contact group that “negotiations haven’t ended” and the focus now had to be on a “smooth transition” of the text to the COP.

SBSTA
Chair Carlos Fuller, Belize, opened the session. 
ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS: With an amendment to the agenda sub-item on assessments of the IPCC and the global stocktake to read “Advice on how the assessment of the IPCC can inform the global stocktake referred to in Article 14 of the Paris Agreement,” parties adopted the agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/2016/1) and agreed to the organization of work.
The following items were briefly considered and forwarded to contact groups: scope of the next periodic review of the long-term global goal; response measures: improved forum and work programme; and modalities, work programme and functions under the Paris Agreement; and modalities for the accounting of financial resources in accordance with Article 9.7, of the Paris Agreement.
The following items were briefly considered and forwarded to informal consultations:
COOPERATION WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS: In the afternoon, the Secretariat reported on its cooperative activities (FCCC/SBSTA/2016/INF.3). The IPCC reported on IPCC 43 decisions, including on producing a special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
OTHER MATTERS: Parties took note of the synthesis report on the technical assessment process for proposed forest reference emission levels and/or forest reference levels (FCCC/SBSTA/2016/INF.2).
The SBSTA plenary then suspended and will reconvene Wednesday, 18 May.
CONTACT GROUPS: MODALITIES FOR ACCOUNTING OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES PROVIDED AND MOBILIZED THROUGH PUBLIC INTERVENTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 9.7 OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT: In the contact group, delegates discussed the mode of work. Maldives, for AOSIS, AUSTRALIA and NEW ZEALAND proposed discussions based on previous work by the SBSTA and the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF). CHINA noted that the COP has not adopted some SCF reports. Co-Chair Outi Honkatukia (Finland) said the Secretariat would make previous reports available and informal consultations would convene Tuesday, 17 May.
COMMON METRICS TO CALCULATE THE CO2 EQUIVALENCE OF GHGs: During informal consultations, some parties wanted to close this item under the SBSTA, noting that the APA is mandated to consider it. Others preferred to hold a technical discussion under the SBSTA. Parties will consider draft conclusions on Wednesday, 18 May.
SBI
Chair Tomasz Chruszczow, Poland, opened the session.
ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS: Chair Chruszczow invited parties to adopt the provisional agenda (FCCC/2016/SBI/1) with the sub-item on information contained in national communications from non-Annex I parties to the Convention held in abeyance. He said that SBI Vice-Chair Zhihua Chen (China) would convene informal consultations on this sub-item.
Thailand, for the G-77/CHINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA and opposed by Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, and the EU, called for amending the agenda item on the registry of NDCs by removing a reference to Paris Agreement Article 4.12 (on a public registry for NDCs) from its title. Chair Chruszczow reported that many parties had called for consideration of capturing adaptation efforts in a public registry.
After some debate, Chair Chruszczow proposed, and parties agreed, to adopt the agenda with the sub-item on non-Annex I national communications held in abeyance, and without the item on the NDC registry, on which parties agreed to hold further consultations for a way forward.
REPORTING FROM NON-ANNEX I PARTIES: Provision of financial and technical support: The GEF reported on its activities relating to the preparation of biennial update reports (BURs). IRAN noted the unresponsiveness of the GEF Secretariat to its inquiries on why project support was not received. Chair Chruszczow will hold informal consultations with interested parties to draft conclusions.
Summary reports on the technical analysis of BURs: The SBI took note of the summary reports on the technical analysis of BURs published since SBI 43.

WORKSHOP: EXPLORING FINANCING AND USE OF THE CDM BY INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE FINANCE INSTITUTIONS
The workshop considered experiences in financing CDM projects, and explored barriers to and opportunities for utilizing the CDM to support climate financing activities. Speakers suggested making the CDM pipeline available for climate finance from the GCF, noted the CDM plays a minimal role in a growing but primarily self-labeling green bond market, and advocated certifying finance that is compatible with NDCs. One panelist emphasized that results-based finance is one of multiple financial tools that together can deliver results. Others urged recognizing the trade-offs between certainty in accounting with speed in registration. Recommendations for the CDM included changing the EB from a political to a professional body and considering new metrics, such as carbon intensity. Participants debated the CDM’s potential to fund adaptation and underscored the need to distinguish climate finance from offsetting.
IN THE CORRIDORS
After a well-deserved break from negotiations, refreshed delegates arrived at the World Conference Center Bonn. Many parties indicated readiness to start “putting some flesh onto the bones of the Paris Agreement.” Indeed, the words “unity” and “momentum” seemed omnipresent, with one participant pointing to the strong message sent by the 177 parties that have already signed the Paris Agreement.
While one delegate warned of the dangers of becoming “dizzy with euphoria,” some concerns rose that the SBI agenda item on the registry of NDCs mandated by the Paris outcome did not adequately reflect adaptation. Others expressed concern with the proposed APA agenda, but seemed hopeful that consultations would pave the way for a smooth start to its substantive work. Most countries indeed seemed to be determined to “ride the wave” of goodwill generated by Paris.

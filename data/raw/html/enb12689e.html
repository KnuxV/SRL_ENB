<p>The UN Climate Change Conference convened from 7-19 November 2016, in Marrakech, Morocco. It included the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the 12th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 12), and, with the entry into force of the Paris Agreement, the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 1). Three subsidiary bodies (SBs) also met, the 45th sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 45) and Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI 45), and the second part of the first session of the <em>Ad Hoc </em>Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA 1-2).</p>
<p>The UN Climate Change Conference brought together over 22,500 participants, including nearly 15,800 government officials, 5,400 representatives of UN bodies and agencies, intergovernmental organizations and civil society organizations, and 1,200 members of the media.</p>
<p>Negotiations in Marrakech focused on matters relating to the entry into force and the implementation of the Paris Agreement, including under the COP, CMP, CMA, APA, SBI and SBSTA. During the first week, work was concentrated under the APA, SBI and SBSTA, which closed on Monday, 14 November, and Tuesday, 15 November.</p>
<p>During the second week, following the closure of the APA, SBI and SBSTA, the CMA opened. The joint high-level segment under the COP, CMP and CMA brought together over 70 heads of state and government, in addition to ministers and heads of delegation to generate political will. In addition, work continued under the COP and CMP. On Thursday, 17 November, the Presidency read out the Marrakech Action Proclamation for Our Climate and Sustainable Development to the COP plenary.</p>
<p>Throughout the meeting informal consultations convened under the COP on entry into force of the Paris Agreement and under the COP Presidency on the convening of CMA 1. These informal consultations were conducted back-to-back, engaging, <em>inter alia</em>, on where to house “orphan issues,” the timing of the next or resumed CMA session (2017 or 2018), and whether the Adaptation Fund should serve the Paris Agreement.    </p>
<p> Parties adopted 35 decisions, 25 under the COP, eight under the CMP and two under the CMA, that, <em>inter alia</em>: provide guidance on the completion of the work programme under the Paris Agreement and decide that the Adaptation Fund should serve the Paris Agreement; advance the preparations for the entry into force of the Paris Agreement and CMA; adopt the terms of reference (ToR) for the Paris Committee on Capacity- building (PCCB); approve the five-year workplan of the Warsaw International Mechanism to address loss and damage associated with impacts of climate change (WIM) Executive Committee (ExCom); provide further guidance on the review of the WIM; enhance climate technology development and transfer through the Technology Mechanism; address long-term finance; provide guidance to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF); initiate a process to identify the information to be provided in accordance with Paris Agreement Article 9.5 (biennial finance communications by developed countries); continue and enhance the Lima work programme on gender; improve the effectiveness of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the Convention (education, training and public awareness); adopt the ToR for the third review of the Adaptation Fund; and adopt a revised scale of contributions to the Trust Fund for the core budget of the UNFCCC in 2016-2017.</p>
<h2><strong>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC</strong></h2>
<p>The international political response to climate change began with the 1992 adoption of the UNFCCC, which sets out a legal framework for stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to avoid “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” The Convention, which entered into force on 21 March 1994, has 197 parties. In December 1997, delegates to COP 3 in Kyoto, Japan, agreed to a protocol to the UNFCCC that committed industrialized countries and countries in transition to a market economy to achieve emissions reduction targets. These countries, known as Annex I parties under the UNFCCC, agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six GHGs by an average of 5% below 1990 levels in 2008-2012 (the first commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to country. The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005 and now has 192 parties. In December 2015, at COP 21 in Paris, France, parties agreed to the Paris Agreement that specifies that countries will submit progressively ambitious nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and that aggregate progress on mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation will be reviewed every five years in a global stocktake. The Paris Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016. </p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM NEGOTIATIONS, 2005-2009:</strong> Convening in Montreal, Canada, in 2005, CMP 1 established the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Working Group on Annex I Parties’ Further Commitments under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-KP) in accordance with Protocol Article 3.9, which mandated consideration of Annex I parties’ further commitments at least seven years before the end of the first commitment period. </p>
<p>In December 2007, COP 13 and CMP 3 in Bali, Indonesia, resulted in agreement on the Bali Roadmap on long-term issues. COP 13 adopted the Bali Action Plan (BAP) and established the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention (AWG-LCA), with a mandate to focus on mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology, capacity building and a shared vision for long-term cooperative action. Negotiations on Annex I parties’ further commitments continued under the AWG-KP. The deadline for concluding the two-track negotiations was 2009 in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
<p><strong>COPENHAGEN: </strong>The UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen took place in December 2009. The high-profile event was marked by disputes over transparency and process. Late in the evening of 18 December, these talks resulted in a political agreement, the “Copenhagen Accord,” which was presented to the COP plenary for adoption. After 13 hours of debate, delegates ultimately agreed to “take note” of the Copenhagen Accord and to extend the mandates of the negotiating groups until COP 16 and CMP 6 in 2010. In 2010, over 140 countries indicated support for the Accord. More than 80 countries also provided information on their national mitigation targets or actions. </p>
<p><strong>CANCUN:</strong> The UN Climate Change Conference in Cancun, Mexico, took place in December 2010, where parties adopted the Cancun Agreements and agreed to consider the adequacy of the global long-term goal during a 2013-2015 review. The Cancun Agreements established several new institutions and processes, including the GCF, the Cancun Adaptation Framework, the Adaptation Committee and the Technology Mechanism, which includes the Technology Executive Committee (TEC) and the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN).</p>
<p><strong>DURBAN:</strong> The UN Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa, took place in November and December 2011. Among other outcomes, parties agreed to launch the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) with a mandate “to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties” no later than 2015, to enter into force in 2020. In addition, the ADP was mandated to explore actions to close the pre-2020 ambition gap in relation to the below 2°C target.</p>
<p><strong>DOHA: </strong>The UN Climate Change Conference in Doha, Qatar, took place in November and December 2012. The conference resulted in a package of decisions referred to as the “Doha Climate Gateway.” These included amendments to the Kyoto Protocol to establish its second commitment period (2013-2020), and agreement to terminate the AWG-KP’s and AWG-LCA’s work and negotiations under the BAP. </p>
<p><strong>WARSAW: </strong>The UN Climate Change Conference in Warsaw, Poland, took place in November 2013. The meeting adopted an ADP decision that, <em>inter alia</em>, invites parties to initiate or intensify domestic preparations for their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs). Parties also adopted decisions establishing the WIM, and the Warsaw Framework for REDD+. </p>
<p><strong>LIMA:</strong> The UN Climate Change Conference in Lima, Peru, took place in December 2014. COP 20 adopted the “Lima Call for Climate Action,” which set in motion the negotiations towards the 2015 agreement by elaborating the elements of a draft negotiating text and the process for submitting and synthesizing INDCs, while also addressing pre-2020 ambition. Parties also adopted 19 decisions that, <em>inter alia,</em> help operationalize the WIM, establish the Lima work programme on gender and adopt the Lima Ministerial Declaration on Education and Awareness-raising. </p>
<p><strong>PARIS:</strong> The UN Climate Change Conference convened in Paris, France, in November and December 2015 and culminated in the adoption of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The Agreement sets the goals of: keeping global average temperature rise well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels; and enhancing global adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change. </p>
<p>The Agreement creates two five-year cycles. One cycle is for parties to submit NDCs, each successive contribution representing a progression from the previous contribution, reflecting common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances. By 2020, parties whose NDCs contain a timeframe up to 2025 are requested to communicate a new NDC and parties with an NDC timeframe up to 2030 are requested to communicate or update these contributions. The second cycle is a global stocktake of collective efforts, beginning in 2023, following a facilitative dialogue in 2018. </p>
<p>All parties are to report on their efforts using a common transparency framework, with support provided for developing countries to fulfill their reporting obligations. The Agreement establishes, <em>inter alia</em>, a mechanism to contribute to the mitigation of GHG emissions and support sustainable development and a technology framework to provide overarching guidance to the Technology Mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>PARIS AGREEMENT ENTRY INTO FORCE: </strong>The Paris Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016, 30 days after the dual entry into force requirement of ratification by at least 55 countries representing at least 55% of global GHG emissions was met. As of 19 November 2016, 111 countries have ratified the agreement.</p>
<h2><strong>REPORT OF THE MARRAKECH CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE</strong></h2>
<p> On Monday, 7 November 2016, COP 21/CMP 11 President Ségolène Royal, France, opened UN Climate Change Conference, reporting that 100 countries had ratified the Paris Agreement and appealing to remaining parties to the UNFCCC to ratify before the end of 2016. Describing COP 22 as an “African COP,” she called for climate justice for the continent. </p>
<p>Salaheddine Mezouar, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Morocco, was elected as the COP 22/CMP 12 President by acclamation. Welcoming delegates to the “red city,” he said the conference demonstrates a whole continent’s commitment to climate action. Commending countries on the rapid entry into force of the Paris Agreement, he called for building on this dynamic to give tangible meaning to the Agreement and to “finalize support mechanisms.”</p>
<p>UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa emphasized that achieving the aims of the Paris Agreement is not a given, noting the need for: adaptation support; progress on the loss and damage mechanism; and a level and predictability of finance that can catalyze low-emission development. </p>
<p>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Chair Hoesung Lee relayed the IPCC’s “action-packed” work programme contributing to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on the basis of science, including the approval of the outline of the special report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, as requested by the UNFCCC COP. </p>
<p>Highlighting Marrakech’s famous gardens, Mohammed Larbi Belcadi, Mayor of Marrakech, relayed the city’s efforts to protect the environment, including through green areas and energy efficiency projects, as well as its commitment to a successful COP leading to concrete solutions.</p>
<p>This report summarizes the negotiations under the COP, CMP, CMA, APA, SBI and SBSTA. </p>

<p><strong>Adoption of the Report on Credentials: </strong>On Friday, 18 November, the COP adopted the report on credentials (FCCC/CP/2016/11).</p>
<p><strong>REPORTS OF THE SUBSIDIARY BODIES: Report of the SBSTA:</strong> The COP took note of the SBSTA 44 report and the draft report of SBSTA 45 (FCCC/SBSTA/2016/2 and L.18). </p>
<p><strong>Report of the SBI:</strong> The COP took note of the report of SBI 44 and the draft report of SBI 45 (FCCC/SBI/2016/8 and Add.1, and L.25).</p>
<p><strong>Report of the APA: </strong>The COP took note of the reports of APA 1 and APA 1-2 (FCCC/APA/2016/2 and L.5) and adopted the decision (FCCC/APA/2016/L.4/Add.1).</p>
<p><strong>PREPARATIONS FOR ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT AND CMA 1:</strong> This item was introduced on Monday, 7 November and subsequently discussed in informal consultations led by the COP Presidency, generally in conjunction with informal consultations convened under the auspices of the CMA Presidency. The COP adopted the draft decision on Friday, 18 November.</p>
<p>During informal consultations, parties’ views diverged on whether to have a decision from the CMA, and, in the event of a decision, whether it should be short and procedural or substantive. Parties diverged on whether to use the early versions of draft COP or CMA decisions on this matter as the basis for negotiation. On Friday, 18 November, a draft was proposed that parties accepted as a basis for negotiations. Regarding a possible decision, parties’ discussions centered on: timing issues related to reconvening CMA 1; addressing issues mandated under the Paris outcome without an agenda item; and organizing the 2018 facilitative dialogue.</p>
<p>On when to reconvene CMA 1, parties favored either 2017 or 2018. Those in favor of 2017, all of which were developing countries, stressed that some decisions under the APA and other SBs could be ready in 2017 and should be promptly adopted. These countries warned of reputational risks to delaying decisions until 2018, given the political momentum around the Paris Agreement. </p>
<p>Developed and some developing countries in favor of reconvening CMA 1 in 2018, recalled that the 2001 Marrakech Accords required three years of negotiations, and that the Accords were a “package” of rules. These countries noted the reputational risks to reconvening the CMA in 2017 without any decisions ready to adopt. One group of developing country parties suggested reconvening in 2017 to undertake a stocktaking exercise and adopt no decisions, which other groups opposed.</p>
<p>On issues mandated under the Paris outcome without an agenda item, both developed and developing countries identified such “orphan issues.” During informal consultations, parties discussed the informal note put forward by the COP Presidency that cited: common time frames for NDCs; adjustment of NDCs; “enabling” the response measures forum; recognition of adaptation efforts; guidance to the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism; guidance to the LDCs Fund (LDCF) and Special Climate Change Fund; new collective goal on finance; <em>ex ante</em> finance information; and education, training and public awareness.</p>
<p>Some developed countries opposed listing orphan issues at this stage, noting that the APA agenda includes an item on further matters related to implementation of the Paris Agreement, which has a sub-item on preparing for entry into force of the Paris Agreement. Other developed countries stressed that the CMA should invite the COP to continue to undertake any work related to the CMA’s work programme. Other parties suggested a tiered approach that first mentions issues mandated to CMA 1. Some developing country groups urged addressing all orphan issues in a comprehensive manner to ensure that all are addressed without delay, or prioritizing among issues, while some developed countries noted that only two issues are mandated by the Paris outcome for CMA 1, asking parties to “renegotiate.” </p>
<p>The Adaptation Fund was the subject of discussion in this context. Many developing countries suggested that a CMA decision be taken that the Adaptation Fund “will,” “should” or “shall” serve the Paris Agreement, while others recalled the Paris Agreement’s wording that the Adaptation Fund “may” serve it.</p>
<p>On the 2018 facilitative dialogue, views diverged on whether, and how, to provide guidance to the COP Presidencies, with some suggesting submissions and many stressing the need for consultations with parties and observers. Some parties suggested an agenda item on this, which others opposed. One group proposed that the 2018 dialogue be based upon the 2016 facilitative dialogue on enhancing ambition and support, which others opposed.</p>
<p>In the CMA plenary, Venezuela and India asked that a footnote be added to the decision paragraph stating that the COP takes note of the resolutions adopted at the 39th session of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly to reflect their reservations and concerns about ICAO 39’s resolutions. CMA President Mezouar stated that these reservations would be taken note of. On Saturday, 19 November, the COP adopted the decision.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome:</em></strong> Decision FCCC/CP/2016/L.12 is comprised of six parts. </p>
<p>On the entry into force and signature of the Paris Agreement, the COP, <em>inter alia</em>, congratulates parties that have ratified, accepted of approved the Paris Agreement and invites those that have not done so to deposit their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, where appropriate, with the depository as soon as possible. </p>
<p>On the completion of the work programme under the Paris Agreement, the COP, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>decides to convene at COP 23 a joint meeting with the second session of CMA 1 (CMA 1-2) to review progress on the implementation of the work programme under the Paris Agreement; and</li>
<li>also decides to conclude the work programme under the Paris Agreement as soon as possible and to forward the outcomes, at the latest, to the third part of CMA 1 (CMA 1-3) to be convened in conjunction with COP 24 for its consideration and adoption.</li>
</ul>
<p>On additional matters relating to the implementation of the Paris Agreement, the COP takes note of the invitation of the CMA to request the APA to continue its consideration of possible additional matters relating to the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the convening of CMA 1.</p>
<p>On the Adaptation Fund, the COP requests the APA in its consideration of the necessary preparatory work on the Adaptation Fund to address the governance and institutional arrangements, safeguards and operating modalities for the Adaptation Fund to serve the Paris Agreement. The COP invites parties to submit their views on the governance and institutional arrangements, safeguards and operating modalities for the Adaptation Fund to serve the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>On the 2018 facilitative dialogue, the COP requests the COP 22 President, in collaboration with the incoming COP 23 President, to undertake inclusive and transparent consultations with parties on the organization of the facilitative dialogue referred to in Decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 20, including during the SB 46 and at COP 23, and to jointly report to COP 23 on the preparations for the dialogue.</p>
<p>On enhanced action prior to 2020, the COP, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>underscores the urgent need for the entry into force of the Doha Amendment and calls on those parties to the Kyoto Protocol that have not done so to deposit their instruments of acceptance with the Depositary as soon as possible;</li>
<li>commends the High-Level Champions and welcomes the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action;</li>
<li>takes note of the resolutions adopted at ICAO 39; and</li>
<li>welcomes the adoption of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CONSIDERATION OF PROPOSALS BY PARTIES FOR AMENDMENTS OT THE CONVENTION UNDER ARTICLE 15: Proposal from the Russian Federation to Amend Convention Article 4.2(f):</strong> Parties first considered this item (FCCC/CP/2011/5) on Wednesday, 9 November, and agreed to informal consultations under the Presidency. On Thursday, 17 November, the COP agreed to continue consideration of this sub-item at COP 23.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal from Papua New Guinea and Mexico to Amend Convention Articles 7 and 18: </strong>Parties first considered this item (FCCC/CP/2011/4/Rev.1) on Wednesday, 9 November, and agreed to informal consultations under the COP Presidency. On Thursday, 17 November, the COP agreed to continue consideration of this sub-item at COP 23.</p>
<p><strong>REPORT OF THE ADAPTATION COMMITTEE: </strong>This item (FCCC/SB/2016/2) was first considered on Wednesday, 9 November, and was referred to SBSTA and SBI for consideration. Discussions on this item are summarized under the SBI agenda item on the Adaptation Committee (see page 25).</p>
<p><strong>WIM:</strong> This item (FCCC/SB/2016/3) was first considered on Wednesday, 9 November, and was referred to the SBSTA and SBI for consideration. Discussions on this item are summarized under the SBI agenda item on the WIM (see page 25).<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES: Joint Annual Report of the TEC and the CTCN:</strong> This item (FCCC/SB/2016/1) was first considered on Wednesday, 9 November, and referred to the SBSTA and SBI for consideration. Discussions on this item are summarized under the SBI agenda item on the joint annual report of the TEC and the CTCN (see page 26).</p>
<p><strong>Linkages between the Technology Mechanism and the Financial Mechanism of the Convention: </strong>This item (FCCC/CP/2014/6, SB/2016/1, CP/2016/7 and Add.1) was first considered by the COP on Wednesday, 9 November. Parties agreed the COP Presidency would conduct informal consultations. Informal consultations, co-facilitated by El Hadji Mbaye Diagne (Senegal) and Elfriede More (Austria), and informal informal consultations also took place throughout the meeting.</p>
<p>During the informal consultations, parties considered, <em>inter alia</em>: progress made; areas for enhanced cooperation; guidance to the GCF; inviting developing countries to use support from the GCF Readiness and Support Programme to implement Technology Action Plans; and whether or not to conclude this agenda item.</p>
<p>On progress made, many parties appreciated: an SBI 44 in-session workshop; GCF, GEF and TEC presence at one another’s meetings; and annual meetings convened by the GCF to enhance cooperation with UNFCCC bodies.</p>
<p>On areas for enhanced cooperation, parties discussed relaying progress in annual reports and creating a coordination mechanism.</p>
<p>On guidance to the GCF, parties discussed, <em>inter alia</em>, requesting the GCF to prioritize CTCN-supported projects.<strong> </strong>A number of developed countries, opposed by a large group of developing countries, advocated deleting a paragraph on this matter, noting guidance to the GCF should be addressed under the respective COP agenda sub-item. Parties eventually agreed to this approach.</p>
<p>On inviting developing countries to use support from the GCF Readiness and Support Programme to implement Technology Action Plans,<strong> </strong>many parties, opposed by others, supported deleting a reference to the Poznan strategic programme on technology transfer, since all its funds have already been allocated. A GCF representative clarified that matters related to the implementation of Technology Action Plans “should be oriented to other modalities rather than readiness under the GCF.”</p>
<p>On whether to conclude this agenda item, parties considered two text options: concluding the agenda item and deciding that future consideration of issues relating to this agenda item will be undertaken under other relevant items; or agreeing to further consider this matter at the “Xth” COP session.</p>
<p> Some groups of developing countries stressed the need to include this agenda item on the next COP agenda to ensure the Technology Mechanism is “tied to support.” Many developed countries preferred to conclude this agenda item and hold an in-session workshop, not in four years as previously proposed, but at the first SB session in 2018. Parties eventually agreed to continue consideration of this item at COP 24.</p>
<p>On Thursday, 17 November, the COP adopted the decision.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome:</em></strong> In its decision (FCCC/CP/2016/L.6), the COP, emphasizing the importance of financial resources at all stages of the technology cycle, including at the early stages, in order to enable parties to enhance their mitigation and adaptation action, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>welcomes: the progress made by the TEC, the CTCN and the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism in further elaborating the linkages between the Technology Mechanism and the Financial Mechanism; and the increased engagement between the GCF and the CTCN, particularly with respect to utilizing the GCF’s Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme and Project Preparation Facility;</li>
<li>encourages: the GCF Board to continue to invite the Chairs of the TEC and the Advisory Board of the CTCN to future meetings of the GCF Board on issues of common interest; and the TEC, the CTCN and the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism to enhance the involvement of relevant stakeholders as they strengthen the linkages between the Technology Mechanism and the Financial Mechanism; </li>
<li>invites: GCF national designated authorities and focal points to use the support available to them under the Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme to conduct Technology Needs Assessments (TNAs) and develop Technology Action Plans, among other things; and developing countries to develop and submit technology-related projects, including those resulting from TNAs and from the technical assistance of the CTCN, to the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism for implementation; and</li>
<li>agrees to continue its consideration of this matter at COP 24.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MATTERS RELATED TO FINANCE: Long-Term Climate Finance: </strong>This item (FCCC/CP/2016/5) was first considered during the COP plenary on Wednesday, 9 November and subsequently addressed in a contact group and informal consultations held during the first and second week, co-chaired by Georg Borsting (Norway) and Andres Mogro (Ecuador). </p>
<p>Parties began their work during the first week with identifying elements of a draft decision text, including through presentation of written submissions by several groups of parties on Saturday, 12 November. Based on these exchanges, the Co-Chairs produced a revised draft decision text on which delegates worked during the second week of COP 22. </p>
<p>Parties focused on, <em>inter alia:</em> how to avoid a finance gap; access to and delivery of finance; SCF recommendations and work on loss and damage; and adaptation finance. India underscored the need to identify sources within and outside the UNFCCC and called for reviewing the ToR of the “financial bodies.” Mauritania said the allocation of financial resources should be based on criteria of justice and fairness. </p>
<p>Parties agreed on the usefulness of an in-session workshop and welcomed the SCF’s second biennial assessment. On the<strong>in-session workshop</strong>, parties’ views differed on text requesting the Secretariat to conduct a needs assessment programme for developing countries and on workshop topics. Some preferred focusing on developing countries’ access to climate finance and setting a new quantified goal for finance, while others supported focusing on the role of policies and enabling environments in mobilizing finance at scale.</p>
<p>Agreeing to focus the 2017 workshop on long-term climate finance, parties commented on the workshop’s scope, with the Philippines, for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), calling for it to: be informed by the High-Level Ministerial Dialogue on Climate Finance; increase clarity on how to scale up climate finance; and, with the Independent Alliance of Latin America and the Caribbean (AILAC), consider how to advance adaptation finance. The European Union (EU) said the workshop should “help understanding the apparent gaps” in clarity. Canada noted submissions on strategies and approaches that can increase clarity. Parties’ views differed on whether to emphasize progress made or to highlight the adaptation finance gap. Some parties suggested focusing not only on needs but more specifically on how to: translate needs into projects; address and obtain access to finance for the identified projects; and realize enabling environments and policies to attract financial resources at the scale necessary to support those actions. Others stressed their opposition to referring to “bankable projects.” </p>
<p>Views further differed on how to work on scaling up finance support and <em>ex ante</em> information.</p>
<p><strong>On scaling up</strong>, several groups stressed they wanted to see “something robust on adaptation finance.” In addition, in a paragraph on “urging developed countries to scale up their provision of financial support to developing countries in line with the latter’s increasing needs and priorities identified in a country-driven manner,” one developing country group suggested adding “as identified in adaptation communications where they exist,” and one developing country party suggested replacing “financial support” with “financial resources.” Other parties suggested deleting the paragraph.</p>
<p><strong>On <em>ex ante</em> information</strong>, several parties sought deletion of all paragraphs under this section, suggesting “this goes beyond the scope of the discussion under this agenda sub-item.”</p>
<p>On Friday, 18 November, the COP adopted the decision on long-term climate finance.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome:</em></strong> In its decision (FCCC/CP/2016/L.11), the COP, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>notes with appreciation the 2016 biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows of the SCF, in particular its key findings and recommendations, highlighting the increase of climate finance  flows from developed country parties to developing country parties;</li>
<li>welcomes the progress by developed country parties towards reaching the goal of jointly mobilizing US$100 billion annually by 2020, and urges them to continue to scale up mobilized climate finance towards this goal; </li>
<li>welcomes the progress made and requests parties to continue to enhance their enabling environments and policy frameworks to facilitate the mobilization and effective deployment of climate finance;</li>
<li>urges developed country parties to continue their efforts to channel a substantial share of public climate funds to adaptation activities and to strive to achieve a greater balance between finance for mitigation and for adaptation, recognizing the importance of adaptation finance;</li>
<li>notes the increase in adaptation finance to date and the need to significantly scale up adaptation finance, as well as the progress made in enhancing access to finance by developing countries, while emphasizing the continued challenges that developing countries face and encouraging parties and relevant institutions to enhance access to finance from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral;</li>
<li>requests the Secretariat to prepare a compilation and synthesis of the biennial submissions from developed country parties on updated strategies and approaches for scaling up climate finance from 2014 to 2020;</li>
<li>invites developing country parties that have not already done so to submit their biennial update reports as soon as possible;</li>
<li>decides that the in-session workshops on long-term climate finance in 2017 and 2018 will, with a view to scaling up climate finance for mitigation and adaptation, focus on experiences and lessons learned from articulating and translating needs identified in country-driven processes into projects and programmes, roles of policies and enabling environments for mitigation and adaptation finance, and facilitating enhanced access; and</li>
<li>requests the Secretariat to organize these workshops, ensure they are balanced in and attended by both public and private sector actors, and prepare summary reports.</li>
</ul>
<p>The COP also invites parties and relevant institutions to consider that: </p>
<ul>
<li>country-driven processes for the assessment of adaptation needs in developing countries are fundamental for scaling up adaptation finance;</li>
<li>the NDCs and adaptation communications could constitute a good opportunity for supporting the scaling up of adaptation finance;</li>
<li>the role of the private sector in adaptation finance needs to be further enhanced;</li>
<li>access to adaptation finance remains a challenge, particularly for small island developing states (SIDS) and LDCs;</li>
<li>better information needs to be generated for more efficient planning, including through enhanced tracking of adaptation flows;</li>
<li>strengthening national public financing management systems is vital to support countries to effectively manage, track and monitor climate finance; and</li>
<li>maximizing the effectiveness of adaptation finance is important in ensuring that limited financial resources achieve the greatest possible impact.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Report of the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) and Review of the Functions of the SCF: </strong>This item (FCCC/CP/2016/8 and MISC.1) was first considered during the COP plenary on Wednesday, 9 November, and subsequently addressed in contact group meetings and informal consultations co-chaired by Ngedikes Olai Uludong (Palau) and Delphine Eyraud (France).</p>
<p>Parties began their work during the first week by commenting on the draft decision, including: welcoming the report; acknowledging the useful forum on loss and damage, which engaged with the private sector; recognizing the SCF’s achievements in building linkages with other bodies, such as the Technology Mechanism; and urging the SCF to take into account alternative non-market approaches. </p>
<p>In addition, one group of parties noted the SCF would benefit from engaging with the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the private sector in developing countries. Another group called for clear timelines and outputs from this session on how to advance facilitation of adaptation in developing countries. Some countries noted the review of the functions as relevant regarding the SCF’s transition to serving the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>During the second week, parties worked on the Co-Chairs’ streamlined draft decision text until it was ready, on Thursday, 17 November, to be forwarded to the COP.</p>
<p>On Friday, 18 November, the COP adopted the decision.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome:</em></strong> In its decision (FCCC/CP/2016/L.9/Rev.1), the COP, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>

<li>reiterates that the SCF will integrate financing for forests-related considerations into its 2017 workplan, where appropriate, and continue work on this matter in the context of the overall issue of improving coherence and coordination in the delivery of climate change financing, taking into account all relevant decisions on forests.</li>
</ul>
<p>The annex to the decision contains the summary and recommendations by the SCF on the 2016 biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows, with sections on: context and mandates; challenges and limitations; key findings; and recommendations. The key findings: explicate methodological issues relating to MRV of public and private climate finance; provide an overview of current climate finance flows in 2013-2014; and, by way of assessment of climate finance flows, offer insights into key questions of interest in the context of the UNFCCC negotiations, including support for adaptation and mitigation, levels of finance for different regions, and how finance is delivered.</p>
<p><strong>Report of the GCF to the COP and Guidance to the GCF:</strong> This item (FCCC/CP/2016/7 and Add.1, 8, and INF.1) was first considered during the COP plenary on Wednesday, 9 November, and subsequently addressed in contact group meetings and informal consultations co-chaired by Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) and Stefan Schwager (Switzerland).</p>
<p>Parties began their work during the first week by commenting and providing written submissions on the draft decision. The Co-Chairs streamlined the draft decision several times, including on the basis of progress reached during the second week during self-facilitated drafting meetings among parties. On Wednesday, 16 November, the contact group forwarded agreed draft text to the COP.</p>
<p>During the discussions, many welcomed the SCF’s report and draft guidance, noting they provided a good basis and reflected progress made. Parties further highlight various issues. The Philippines, for the G-77/China, stressed the need to ensure that the GCF continues to serve all developing countries in the Convention. Egypt, for the African Group, suggested highlighting that the GCF is “an institution to stay.” The Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDCs) sought for ways to help the GCF Board with transforming the pledges made by countries into finalized support.</p>
<p>Maldives, for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), and South Africa lamented that the procedures of accreditation remain too complex. The US and New Zealand highlighted the important role of the private sector in ensuring the Fund functions. Nicaragua said private sector investments in general could be better directed to renewable energy, energy efficiency, reforestation and avoidance of deforestation. </p>
<p>On Friday, 18 November, the COP adopted the decision.</p>

<p><strong>Report of the GEF to the COP and Guidance to the GEF:</strong> This item (FCCC/CP/2016/6 and Add.1, 8, and INF.1) was first considered during the COP plenary on Wednesday, 9 November, and subsequently addressed in contact group meetings and informal consultations co-chaired by Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) and Stefan Schwager (Switzerland).</p>
<p>Parties began their work during the first week by providing written submissions for and commenting on a Co-Chairs’ draft decision. Throughout the second week, parties considered a streamlined Co-Chairs’ draft decision, including in informal informal consultations, until reaching agreement on Thursday, 17 November, when the contact group forwarded the draft text to the COP.</p>
<p>Parties’ views differed, <em>inter alia</em>, on a reference to “welcoming the SCF 2016 Biennial Assessment as context for the provision of guidance,” and various textual proposals, including: that the GEF, in its deliberation on the strategy for the seventh replenishment, take into account “any CMA decisions”; and “that all requests for funding which meet GEF focal area strategies and standards are duly and timely examined and responded.”</p>
<p>Parties also disagreed on several additions, including on inserting after text on ensuring that “the support for the Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT) will be included in the seventh replenishment,” the addition “as additional resources to be set aside.”</p>
<p>Discussions also focused on a paragraph requesting the GEF to continue providing, in its annual reports, information on, <em>inter alia</em>, financial support provided for the preparation of national communications  and Biennial Update Reports, with parties disagreeing on references to: “non-Annex I parties”; “developing country parties”; or “parties eligible for funding.”</p>

<p><strong>Sixth Review of the Financial Mechanism: </strong>This item was first considered during the COP plenary on Wednesday, 9 November, when parties agreed on the ToR for the sixth review, with a view to finalizing the review at COP 23. The item was subsequently addressed in contact group meetings and informal consultations co-chaired by Rafael da Soler (Brazil) and Outi Honkatukia (Finland).</p>
<p>Parties accepted the ToR and made various comments on the draft text. The Philippines, for the G-77/China, emphasized the need for coherence of financing under the Convention and “enhanced support to enable enhanced actions.” Canada suggested focusing on areas of complementarity and on increased effectiveness of the Financial Mechanism.</p>
<p>During the second week, parties continued negotiations, including during informal informal meetings, on the Co-Chairs’ revised draft text on updated guidelines for the review, with discussions focusing on sources of information and criteria. On Wednesday, 16 November, the contact group agreed to: delete most textual additions made to the draft text on guidelines; the procedural part of the decision; and forward the draft decision to the COP.</p>
<p>On Friday, 18 November, the COP adopted the decision.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome:</em></strong> In its decision (FCCC/CP/2016/L.4), the COP, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>

</ul>
<p>The annex of the decision contains the updated guidelines for the sixth review of the Financial Mechanism, with sections on: objectives; sources of information; and criteria. </p>
<p><strong>Initiation of the Process to Identify the Information to be provided by Parties in Accordance with Paris Agreement Article 9.5:</strong> This item was first considered during the COP plenary on Wednesday, 9 November, when parties agreed to initiate the process. The item was subsequently addressed in contact group meetings and informal consultations co-chaired by Rafael da Soler (Brazil) and Outi Honkatukia (Finland).</p>
<p>During the first week, parties exchanged views, including on mechanisms and parameters, which the Co-Chairs captured in a list. During the second week, parties engaged further on several revised Co-Chairs’ non-papers drafted on the basis of bilateral consultations with parties and held several self-facilitated informal informal meetings. On Wednesday, 16 November, the contact group agreed to the draft decision text and forwarded it to the COP.</p>
<p>During discussions, many parties recognized the need for predictability and use of qualitative and quantitative information. The EU noted interlinkages with other agenda items, including submissions on strategy approaches and roadmaps. The Philippines, for the G-77/China, stressed that emphasis should be on country-driven strategies and the needs and priorities of developing countries. Several parties emphasized the need to provide more clarity on <em>ex ante</em> information.</p>
<p>Several parties preferred not to discuss the timelines and frequency of financial information to be communicated, suggesting the Paris Agreement is clear on “biennial communications.” Others noted the text lacks information on how timeframes will be used in submissions. Several parties also stressed a clear distinction between <em>ex ante</em> and <em>ex post</em> information, noting obtaining the latter is more challenging. </p>
<p>Some parties called for focusing on process rather than information and views among parties diverged on identifying the SCF as a “home” for this issue once the agenda item is closed. </p>
<p>Parties’ views continued to differ on a non-exhaustive list of elements with options under sections on: objectives and scope; existing arrangements to build upon; linkages; next steps; and timeline and other arrangements. They also differed on: the way forward; the usefulness of a facilitated in-session workshop in conjunction with SB 46; and a resulting Secretariat’s summary report for consideration at COP 23.</p>
<p>On Friday, 18 November, the COP adopted the decision.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome:</em></strong> In its decision (FCCC/CP/2016/L.2), the COP recalls that developed country parties shall biennially communicate indicative quantitative and qualitative information related to Paris Agreement Articles 9.1 (developed country parties’ existing obligation to provide financial resources to assist developing country parties with respect to mitigation and adaptation) and 9.3 (developed country parties progress in their efforts taking the lead in mobilizing climate finance), including, as available, projected levels of public financial resources to be provided to developing country parties, and that other parties providing resources are encouraged to communicate biennially such information on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>The COP further: requests the Secretariat to organize a roundtable discussion among parties on this matter in conjunction with SB 46 and to prepare a summary report of the roundtable for consideration by COP 23; and agrees to advance work on this matter at COP 23, with a view to providing a recommendation on information to be provided by parties in accordance with Paris Agreement Article 9.5 for consideration and adoption by CMA 1.</p>

<p>Mali, for the African Group, supported by many others, commended outgoing Deputy Executive Secretary Richard Kinley and Dan Bondi Ogolla, UNFCCC Secretariat, for their dedication and outstanding work.</p>
<p>Costa Rica, for AILAC, said although we took first steps in defining the Paris Agreement rulebook we must accelerate our work to meet the urgency of the global challenge of climate change.</p>
<p>China highlighted his country’s commitment to Paris Agreement implementation and building “eco-civilization.”</p>

<p>Business and Industry said businesses provide solutions to moving to low-carbon economies, inside the UNFCCC and outside, including through the World Trade Organization (WTO).</p>
<p>Climate Action Network (CAN) urged parties to ensure that civil society can: strengthen ambition; provide expertise; and provide for public accountability.</p>
<p>Cautioning that “private sector involvement is no substitute for public finance,” Climate Justice Now! highlighted the need for reallocating public financial resources from war and fossil fuel subsidies towards addressing adaptation and loss and damage.</p>

<p>Parties agreed to a contact group co-chaired by Karoliina Anttonen (Finland) and Hlobsile Sikhosana (Swaziland). In discussions, views diverged on most issues, and the contact group decided to delete a large portion of the draft text and forward the “clean” draft decision to the CMP for consideration.</p>
<p>Parties’ views differed on most paragraphs of the draft and revised draft decision sections on: general; baseline and monitoring methodologies; registration of project activities and issuance of CERs; regional and sub-regional distribution; the CDM Loan Scheme; and resources for work on the CDM. Parties could not reach agreement on, <em>inter alia</em>: voluntary cancellation; international aviation issues; references to the GCF; restrictive practices; length of crediting periods; and relevance of the CDM in the context of Paris Agreement Article 6 (cooperative approaches).

<p>Brazil stressed use of CERs in the context of ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). India called for consideration of small projects. The EU called for exploring possibilities to reduce the cost of monitoring by expanding the use of tiered projects. Saint Lucia, for AOSIS, expressed hope for progress on the CER registry’s transparency, double counting, and CDM loan schemes. Some parties underscored concerns with the CDM, including the lack of demand for CERs and ratifications of the Doha Amendment, and suggested that the SBSTA note, rather than express satisfaction with, the CDM’s results. </p>
<p>Parties were able to agree on paragraphs: on the CDM EB report for 2015-2016; on progress of the CDM to date; and encouraging the EB to continue its activities in response to Decision 6/CMP.11 paragraphs 7 and 8 (on exploring options for using the CDM as a tool for other uses, and for the financing of the CDM through international climate financing institutions).</p>
<p>On Thursday, 17 November, the CMP adopted a decision on guidelines on the CDM. </p>

<li>designates as operational entities those entities that have been accredited, and provisionally designated, as operational entities by the EB to carry out the sector-specific validation functions and/or sector-specific verification functions described in the annex.</li>
</ul>
<p>The guidelines contain a general section and sections on: baseline and monitoring methodologies; regional and sub-regional distribution; the CDM Loan Scheme; and resources for work on the CDM. In its annex, the decision provides an overview of the designation of operational entities by CMP 12 and changes in the accreditation status of entities during the EB’s reporting period (17 October 2015 to 17 September 2016).</p>

He noted activity under JI virtually ceased at the end of the first Protocol commitment period and thus, no new projects were created or emission reduction units (ERUs) issued since the previous year’s report. On the review of the JI guidelines, he said the JISC had forwarded recommendations to SBI 44 and the SBI is recommending the CMP close the review and not adopt revised guidelines for the time being. </p>
<p>Parties considered draft recommendations on the annual report of the JISC in the contact group and in informal consultations co-chaired by Dimitar Nikov (France) and Arthur Rolle (Bahamas). </p>
<p>The EU, Switzerland, China and New Zealand supported noting the report.

<ul>
<li>in order to continue the prudent management of resources, the JISC shall meet at least once each year;</li>
<li>with regard to the meetings referred to in the rules of procedure of the JISC, the virtual participation of members or alternates acting as members in its meetings counts towards a quorum and that virtual meetings of the JISC are meetings of the Committee; and</li>
<li>electronic submission of the signed oath of service by members and alternates of the JISC is sufficient to fulfill the requirements of the rules of procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>REPORT OF THE COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE:</strong> This item (FCCC/KP/CMP/2016/3) was first considered on Wednesday, 9 November.</p>
<p>Compliance Committee Co-Chair Gerhard Loibl (Austria) presented the report, highlighting the Committee’s suggestion that the CMP consider ways for Ukraine to formally demonstrate its first commitment period compliance by requesting the Secretariat to make the necessary arrangements to enable the country to retire its units for compliance on an exceptional basis.

<p>On Friday, 18 November, the CMP agreed to encourage the efforts of Ukraine to formally demonstrate its compliance for its commitment under Protocol Article 3.1 for the first commitment period, and to request the Secretariat to make, on an exceptional basis, the necessary arrangements enabling Ukraine to do so by CMP 13.</p>

Bahamas, for the G-77/China, called for additional support for the Fund. </p>
<p>Parties worked on a draft conclusion and a draft decision during contact group meetings and informal consultations co-chaired by Herman Sips (the Netherlands) and Patience Damptey (Ghana).</p>
<p>Bahamas, for the G-77/China, suggested, <em>inter alia</em>, emphasizing the importance of addressing fundraising strategies and recognizing the Adaptation Fund was established at COP 7. Parties’ requests also included references to: the status of available funds, reporting on cash flows, and status of the active pipeline of projects and programme proposals submitted to the Adaptation Fund; fundraising strategies; and the AFB report’s addendum on added value of the Adaptation Fund for the operationalization of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>Egypt proposed including paragraph 53 (the overall evaluation of the Adaptation Fund) of the report in the draft decision. Parties’ views differed on this and several other proposals, including to “recognize the need to revise the CDM” in order to increase predictability and sustainability of the Adaptation Fund’s resources. One developing country group suggested as an alternative option, “recognizing the need for the Doha Amendment to enter into force” to revive the carbon market. Another proposed welcoming the efforts of the AFB to address the predictability and sustainability of its resources, including through the resource mobilization strategy. </p>
<p>On Thursday, 17 November, the CMP adopted the decision. </p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome:</em></strong> In its decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2016/L.3), the CMP:</p>

Bolivia, for the LMDCs, indicated for the record their understanding that the work to be undertaken on Agenda Item 3 (matters relating to the Paris Agreement), including its footnote, is to be in the context of Paris Agreement Articles 2 (strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty) and 3 (NDCs’ progression over time, while recognizing the need to support developing countries).</p>
<p><strong>Application of the Rules of Procedure of the COP:</strong> This item was first considered under the APA. The APA, on Monday, 14 November, forwarded a draft decision to the COP, which was then forwarded to the CMA for consideration. On Friday, 18 November, the CMA adopted the decision. This item is summarized under the APA outcome (see page 20). </p>
<p><strong>Election of Additional Officers:</strong> On Friday, 18 November, Paris Agreement parties elected Diego Pacheco (Bolivia) as an additional Vice-President to the Bureau of COP 22, CMP 12 and CMA 1.</p>
<p><strong>Approval of the Report on Credentials: </strong>On Friday, 18 November, the CMA adopted the report (FCCC/PA/CMA/2016/2).</p>
<p><strong>MATTERS RELATING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT:</strong> This item was first taken up on Wednesday, 16 November. These issues were discussed in informal consultations held by the CMA 1 Presidency, in conjunction with informal consultations held by the COP 22 Presidency on preparations for the entry into force of the Paris Agreement and CMA 1. The informal consultations are summarized under that item of the COP (see page 4).</p>
<p>On Friday, 18 November, CMA President Mezouar invited, and parties agreed, to adopt the decision. He additionally proposed forwarding paragraph 83 of Decision 1/CP.21 (training, public awareness, public participation and public access to information) and Paris Agreement Article 4.10 (consideration of common timeframes for NDCs) to SBI 46 for consideration. </p>
<p>Bolivia, supported by India, said he was not able to support the proposal to forward a very specific, “mitigation-centric” issue for further discussion by the SBI. He stressed issues should be considered in a “comprehensive, single package” and called for a balanced approach to “remaining issues.”</p>
<p>Brazil requested Bolivia reconsider his objection, noting that paragraph 9 of the CMA decision (continuation of consideration of possible additional matters under the APA) already addresses the issue of additional matters in a comprehensive matter. Many parties, including Mali, Costa Rica for AILAC, the US, Maldives for AOSIS, the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the LDCs, and the EU supported the Presidency’s proposal. Several noted the proposal is in line with the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>After informal consultations, Brazil requested the CMA 1 President to ask parties if the proposal to begin consideration of these matters at SBI 47 would be agreeable.</p>
<p>South Africa, for BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China), stated that the group would endorse the proposal with the understanding that pre-2020 issues will be given “equal preference at the next session.”</p>
<p>The CMA agreed to Brazil’s proposal. </p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome: </em></strong>The CMA’s three-part decision is in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2016/L.3. On entry into force and signature of the Paris Agreement, the CMA, <em>inter alia</em>, congratulates parties to the Convention that have ratified, accepted or approved the Paris Agreement and invites those that have not done so to deposit their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, where appropriate, with the Depositary as soon as possible.</p>
<p>On completion of the work programme under the Paris Agreement, the CMA, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>invites the COP to continue to oversee the implementation of the work programme under the Paris Agreement in accordance with the arrangements contained in Decision 1/CP.21 (Paris outcome) and to accelerate work and forward the outcomes at the latest to CMA 1-3 to be convened in conjunction with COP 24 for its consideration and adoption;</li>
<li>also invites the COP to continue to oversee the work on further guidance in relation to the adaptation communication, including, <em>inter alia</em>, as a component of NDCs referred to in Paris Agreement Articles 7.10 and 7.11;</li>
<li>further invites the COP to continue to oversee the work on the development of modalities and procedures for the operation and use of a public registry referred to in Paris Agreement Article 7.12 (adaptation communications);</li>
<li>invites the COP to request the SBSTA, SBI, APA, and the constituted bodies under the Convention to accelerate their work on the work programme resulting from the relevant requests contained in Section III of Decision 1/CP.21 (Paris outcome) and to forward the outcomes to COP 24 at the latest;</li>
<li>invites the COP to request the APA to continue its consideration of possible additional matters relating to the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the convening of CMA 1; and</li>
<li>decides to convene, at CMA 1-2, a joint meeting with COP 23 to review progress on the implementation of the work programme under the Paris Agreement.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the Adaptation Fund, the CMA decides that the Adaptation Fund should serve the Paris Agreement, following and consistent with decisions to be taken at CMA 1-3 to be convened in conjunction with COP 24 and CMP 14 that address the governance and institutional arrangements, safeguards and operating modalities of the Fund.</p>
<p><strong>CLOSING SESSION: </strong>Joint closing statements are summarized under the COP closing statements (see page 11). On Saturday, 19 November, the CMA adopted the report (FCCC/PA/CMA/2016/L.2). The CMA took note of resolutions expressing gratitude to the Government of Morocco and the people of Marrakech (FCCC/CP/2016/L.8/Rev.1, FCCC/KP/CMP/2016/L.5/Rev.1 and FCCC/PA/CMA/2016/L.1/Rev.1). </p>
<p>CMA 1 was suspended at 2:16 am. </p>
<p><strong><em>COP 22, CMP 12 AND CMA 1 JOINT HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT</em></strong></p>
<p>On Tuesday, 15 November, the King of Morocco Mohammed VI highlighted COP 22 as a “decisive turning point” in the implementation of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon highlighted lessons learned during his tenure on: the importance of multilateral solutions and political leadership; the need to secure engagement of all actors; and the important role of the UN in championing science and advancing the moral case for action.</p>
<p>UN General Assembly President Peter Thomson, Fiji, called for maintaining the momentum in addressing climate change, and not only for future generations, as the impacts are felt today by all countries. </p>
<p>UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa called for including indigenous peoples, youth, women and other groups in the transformation towards a low-carbon and climate-resilient world.</p>
<p>Laurene Powell Jobs, Founder and Chair, Emerson Collective, highlighted the stewardship of indigenous peoples in protecting the planet, water and biodiversity, and called for treating them as respected, equal partners.</p>
<p>Mariame Mouhoub, Youth Representative, Morocco, called on delegates to see beyond their differences, work for a just ecological transition, and build solidarity with the world’s most vulnerable.</p>
<p>Highlighting his country’s commitment to lead by example, President François Hollande, France, stressed that the Paris Agreement is “irreversible,” noting governments, businesses, the financial sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and citizens worldwide are undertaking initiatives and finding concrete solutions. He underscored that the US must respect its climate commitments, adding that France would lead a dialogue with the new US President with respect and determination. He stated that, “despite all our differences, what unites us is what we have in common, our planet.”</p>
<p> The joint high-level segment continued from Tuesday, 15 November, to Thursday, 17 November.

<p>MARRAKECH ACTION PROCLAMATION</p>
<p>The Marrakech Action Proclamation for Our Climate and Sustainable Development (MAP) was an initiative of the Moroccan Presidency. Drafts were informally circulated among groups of parties for comment. The final drafts were distributed to groups under the “silence procedure,” where, if no party responds to the draft within 24 hours it is assumed to be agreed. The silence was broken and subsequent revisions were made with the relevant parties. Later, all parties were consulted. </p>
<p>On Thursday, 17 November, Aziz Mekouar, COP Presidency, read the MAP during plenary.</p>
<p><strong><em>Marrakech Action Proclamation:</em></strong> Heads of state, government, and delegations, gathered in Marrakech, on African soil, for the High-Level Segment of COP 22, CMP 12 and CMA 1, at the gracious invitation of His Majesty the King of Morocco, Mohammed VI, issue this proclamation to signal a shift towards a new era of implementation and action on climate and sustainable development:</p>
<ul>
<li>our climate is warming at an alarming and unprecedented rate and we have an urgent duty to respond;</li>
<li>welcome the Paris Agreement, adopted under the Convention, its rapid entry into force, with its ambitious goals, its inclusive nature and its reflection of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances, and we affirm our commitment to its full implementation;</li>
<li>this year has seen extraordinary momentum on climate change worldwide, and in many multilateral fora. This momentum is irreversible―it is being driven not only by governments, but by science, business and global action of all types at all levels;</li>
<li>our task now is to rapidly build on that momentum, together, moving forward purposefully to reduce GHG emissions and to foster adaptation efforts, thereby benefiting and supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs);</li>
<li>we call for the highest political commitment to combat climate change, as a matter of urgent priority;</li>
<li>we call for strong solidarity with those countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and underscore the need to support efforts aimed to enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability;</li>
<li>we call for all parties to strengthen and support efforts to eradicate poverty, ensure food security and take stringent action to deal with climate change challenges in agriculture; </li>
<li>we call for urgently raising ambition and strengthening cooperation amongst ourselves to close the gap between current  emissions trajectories and the pathway needed to meet the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement;</li>
<li>we call for an increase in the volume, flow and access to finance for climate projects, alongside improved capacity and technology, including from developed to developing countries;</li>
<li>we, the developed country parties, reaffirm our US$100 billion mobilization goal;</li>
<li>we unanimously call for further climate action and support, well in advance of 2020, taking into account the specific needs and special circumstances of developing countries, the LDCs and those particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change;</li>
<li>we who are parties to the Kyoto Protocol encourage the ratification of the Doha Amendment;</li>
<li>we collectively call on all non-state actors to join us for immediate and ambitious action and mobilization, building on their important achievements, noting the many initiatives and the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action itself, launched in Marrakech;</li>
<li>the transition in our economies required to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement provides a substantial positive opportunity for increased prosperity and sustainable development;</li>
<li>the Marrakech Conference marks an important inflection point in our commitment to bring together the whole international community to tackle one of the greatest challenges of our time; and</li>
<li>as we now turn towards implementation and action, we reiterate our resolve to inspire solidarity, hope and opportunity for current and future generations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (apa 1-2)</p>
<p>APA Co-Chair Sarah Baashan (Saudi Arabia) opened the meeting on Monday, 7 November, noting that the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement increases pressure on the APA to complete its work expeditiously. A summary of the opening statements is available at: <a href="https://enb.iisd.org/vol12/enb12679e.html">http://enb.iisd.org/vol12/enb12679e.html</a>. </p>
<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS: </strong>Co-Chair Baashan indicated that the agenda and organization of work (FCCC/APA/2016/3 and 2) adopted for APA 1 still apply for APA 1-2. Regarding the request from the COP to conduct the preparatory work so that the Adaptation Fund may serve the Paris Agreement, parties agreed to consider this under the agenda item on preparing for the convening of CMA 1. </p>
<p><strong>Election of Officers: </strong>Co-Chair Baashan noted this had been completed at APA 1-1.</p>
<p><strong>CONTACT GROUP ON AGENDA ITEMS 3-8: </strong>The contact group, co-chaired by APA Co-Chairs Baashan and Jo Tyndall (New Zealand) convened for the first time on Tuesday, 8 November. </p>
<p>Throughout the week, parties considered progress made in informal consultations on: the mitigation section of Decision 1/CP.21 (Paris outcome); further guidance in relation to adaptation communications; the transparency framework’s modalities, procedures and guidelines (MPGs); the global stocktake; the committee to facilitate implementation and promote compliance; and further matters related to the Paris Agreement’s implementation. They also discussed how to capture progress made and further work for the APA. </p>
<p>On capturing progress, Co-Chair Tyndall proposed, and parties agreed to, three components: formal conclusions reflecting further work required, possibly with an annexed decision on CMA-related work; notes from the Co-Facilitators with factual summaries of each item’s discussions; and a Co-Chairs’ note reflecting on outcomes from informals.</p>
<p>On further work for the APA, Maldives, for AOSIS, suggested noting that the APA will require additional time for work in 2017. Switzerland and the US expressed their preference for suspending rather than closing the APA session. Tuvalu, opposed by China and the US, suggested not referring to the need to progress on all items in a “balanced” manner, noting that some issues can be dealt with quickly. Many parties supported the APA holding a “resumed” rather than a “second” session in May 2017. </p>
<p>Parties agreed to a general call for submissions to advance the APA’s work beyond May 2017.</p>
<p>On the final draft conclusions text presented to the contact group, many parties called for,<em> inter alia</em>, giving sufficient recognition to a draft decision proposed by the G-77/China on the Adaptation Fund serving the Paris Agreement. Parties agreed to add language referring to this draft decision, and reflecting other parties’ views that such a decision is premature. </p>
<p><strong>FURTHER GUIDANCE IN RELATION TO THE MITIGATION SECTION OF DECISION 1/CP.21 (Paris Outcome): </strong>This item (FCCC/APA/2016/INF.1) was first considered on Monday, 7 November. Parties agreed to informal consultations, co-facilitated by Gertraud Wollansky (Austria) and Sin Liang Cheah (Singapore). The informal consultations addressed the three agenda sub-items jointly, on: features of NDCs, as specified in the Paris outcome decision, paragraph 26; information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding of NDCs, as specified in paragraph 28; and accounting for parties’ NDCs, as specified in paragraph 31. </p>
<p>During informal consultations, parties focused on: possible linkages between the three sub-items and with Paris Agreement Articles 6 (cooperative approaches) and 13 (transparency framework); guidance to be developed; features of NDCs; accounting for parties’ NDCs, including building on existing arrangements under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol; information to facilitate clarity; and further work.</p>
<p>On guidance to be developed, parties suggested, <em>inter alia</em>: identifying under each sub-item sub-topics to be discussed; focusing on general information common for all parties and information specific to NDC type; and considering how to aggregate the collective impact of NDCs. Many pointed to the Paris Agreement and Decision 1/CP.21 as sources for guidance.</p>
<p>China, for the LMDCs, and Saudi Arabia, for the Arab Group, opposed by New Zealand, highlighted the need to define the scope of NDCs and reflect differentiation in the operational guidance as crosscutting issues. The US underscored that guidance must recognize that parties have a common path but different starting points and paces.</p>
<p>On features of NDCs, parties proposed, among other things: elaboration of the features for each type of NDCs; clear, general, durable and simple guidance; and flexibility for LDCs. </p>
<p>Bolivia for the G-77/China, Colombia for AILAC, the Arab Group, and Australia stressed NDCs’ nationally determined nature. Kuwait highlighted the need to consider the diversity of NDC types, which Argentina noted as important for identifying the specific information to be provided. </p>
<p>Brazil said the features should apply to future rounds of NDCs, which would help parties and the Secretariat to organize and aggregate information for the global stocktake.</p>
<p>On accounting for parties’ NDCs, many developing countries stressed their need for flexibility. India called for “factoring in” differentiation, and the Arab Group said methodologies and approaches in developing countries should be nationally determined. Kenya, for the African Group, and the EU called for guidance to promote progression. Argentina suggested having “different layers of accountability” for different NDC types.</p>
<p>The Arab Group and Iran, opposed by the US and Switzerland, stressed the need to focus on the full scope of NDCs as defined in Paris Agreement Article 3 (NDCs, including progression and support). The LMDCs, opposed by the EU, proposed developing accounting guidance for technology and capacity-building support. Many agreed that Decision 1/CP.21 paragraph 31 (NDCs accounting guidance) provides the basis for developing guidance. </p>
<p>On information to facilitate clarity, parties diverged on whether information indicated in Decision 1/CP.21 paragraph 27 (information to be provided by countries communicating their NDCs) is mandatory, and whether to consider features and information simultaneously.</p>
<p>Brazil said some information specific to objectives should be quantifiable, with others stressing flexibility for qualitative NDCs. Saint Lucia, for the Caribbean Community, proposed identifying information integral to determining NDCs’ aggregate effect.</p>
<p>A number of parties supported distinguishing between general guidance, common for all parties, and specific guidance, arising from different NDC types. The LMDCs advocated requiring a higher level of detail from developed countries.</p>
<p>On further work, Maldives, for AOSIS, and others called for setting a workplan through 2018. Many parties suggested inviting submissions, possibly with guiding questions, and some proposed mandating technical workshops or papers. Brazil proposed party-only workshops and the US a “non-intrusive” facilitated sharing of views. The Arab Group noted technical work would be premature.</p>
<p>New Zealand proposed submissions could address: the purpose of the guidance; linkages between relevant Decision 1/CP.21 paragraphs; how to build on submitted INDCs and NDCs, and guidance from Lima and Paris; and ways to structure and progress work. Countries agreed to have a roundtable, as proposed by AILAC and the LMDCs, instead of workshops.</p>
<p><strong>FURTHER GUIDANCE IN RELATION TO THE ADAPTATION COMMUNICATION, INCLUDING, <em>INTER ALIA</em>, AS A COMPONENT OF NDCs:</strong> This item (FCCC/APA/2016/INF.2) was first considered on Wednesday, 9 November. Parties agreed to informal consultations co-facilitated by Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) and Beth Lavender (Canada) on the purpose, elements, linkages, vehicles, flexibility of adaptation communications, and further work.</p>
<p>On the purpose, many parties underlined the need to raise the profile of adaptation and understand collective progress towards the global adaptation goal. Argentina, for the G-77/China, stressed the need to operationalize the global goal on adaptation. Colombia, for AILAC, and Jamaica, for AOSIS, called for a streamlined purpose, which AILAC said is to catalyze and enhance adaptation action. Sudan, for the African Group, suggested separating the ideas of catalyzing and enhancing adaptation action from issues related to support.</p>
<p>On elements, several parties observed that the Paris Agreement refers to priorities, implementation and support needs, and plans and actions. Saudi Arabia, for the Arab Group, called for further reflection of the financial and other costs of adaptation efforts and actions, noting that some developing countries undertake adaptation actions without MOI and this information could be useful. AOSIS called for explicit reference to support provided.</p>
<p>On linkages, many highlighted the global stocktake’s relevance. The G-77/China called for adaptation communications to inform the global stocktake while New Zealand reminded that adaptation communications are voluntary, and, therefore, could at best “contribute” to a meaningful global stocktake. Norway and others observed links with NAPs, which the Arab Group, said could be a starting point. The EU and US noted linkages with the transparency framework.</p>
<p>On vehicles, the G-77/China, Norway, the EU and others said that parties should be able to choose the most appropriate vehicle for their communications. Mexico suggested regional adaptation communications and reports could be a possibility. Ecuador, for the LMDCs, supported using existing vehicles. AOSIS, supported by many others, underscored the need to avoid reporting burdens.</p>
<p>On flexibility, Switzerland suggested that the APA should provide minimal guidance. Japan said there may be utility in having some basic information that helps each country. The US suggested an executive summary format while the LMDCs opposed high-level communications saying that such communications could undermine the goal of increasing the profile of adaptation.</p>
<p>On further work, the LMDCs and Arab Group proposed the development of a synthesis report on adaptation communications as a component of NDCs, based on submissions by parties. New Zealand opposed, suggesting the Secretariat synthesize parties’ submissions on this item around common themes. The EU and Canada supported requesting the Secretariat to develop a technical paper, containing a compilation of existing guidance on adaptation communications.</p>
<p>Parties agreed to request the Secretariat to develop an information note, to be followed by: new submissions; a synthesis report of submissions; and a workshop.</p>
<p><strong>MPGS FOR THE TRANSPARENCY FRAMEWORK FOR ACTION AND SUPPORT:</strong> This item (FCCC/APA/2016/INF.3) was first considered on Monday, 7 November. Parties agreed to informal consultations co-facilitated by Andrew Rakestraw (US) and Xiang Gao (China). </p>
<p>During informal consultations, parties considered framing questions on: identifying the key elements of the MPGs for the transparency framework; informing the MPGs from existing MRV arrangements and reflecting flexibility for developing countries that need it; and organizing work in 2017-2018. </p>
<p>On elements, Singapore, for the G-77/China, stressed that they should be outlined along the lines of the “shalls” and “shoulds” of Paris Agreement Article 13 (enhanced transparency framework). Many parties advocated addressing all relevant elements of Paris Agreement Article 13 and the decision. The EU noted general agreement in parties’ pre-sessional submissions on three sets of guidelines to be defined, for: reporting; technical expert review; and multilateral consideration. The US suggested elements for reporting, including a section on achievement of a party’s NDC in target years. Bhutan, for the LDCs, called for reviews to take place at least once in every five-year cycle.</p>
<p>On flexibility, New Zealand and Canada supported raising the issue of flexibility in the context of each element of the guidelines. Highlighting the bifurcated structure of the current MRV framework under the Convention as a starting point, China, with Saudi Arabia, for the Arab Group, and the Philippines, stressed that differentiation should be embedded systematically in the structure of the framework, not as a varying aspect of each element. </p>
<p>On a workplan for 2017-2018, some stressed that this would be the most important outcome for COP 22 on this issue. While many agreed on the need for a clearly outlined workplan, opinions varied on the need for and type of further submissions, technical workshops and/or technical papers.</p>
<p>Regarding the topics for submissions and workshops, several parties, including China and Brazil, supported inviting parties to submit their views on all elements of the MPGs. Others, including the EU and Peru, for AILAC, supported focusing on reporting. The Arab Group and Brazil suggested the topics of workshops would emerge from the submissions. The LDCs, New Zealand, Norway, the US and Canada suggested the Secretariat could prepare a synthesis report or other paper as input to the workshop, while the Arab Group considered this premature.</p>
<p><strong>MATTERS RELATING TO THE GLOBAL STOCKTAKE: </strong>This item (FCCC/APA/2016/INF.4) was first considered on Tuesday, 8 November. Parties agreed to informal consultations co-facilitated by Nagmeldin G. Elhassan (Sudan) and Ilze Prūse (Latvia). </p>
<p>During informal consultations, parties shared their views on: modalities; generic/overarching and specific sources of input; the outcome of the global stocktake; and the way forward.</p>
<p>On<strong></strong>modalities, many saw the process comprising a technical and a political phase. Japan, supported by New Zealand, suggested having clear outputs from each phase, such as a report from the technical dialogue. Colombia, for AILAC, suggested an <em>ad hoc</em> working group that would process the technical aspects to produce an output for the political phase. </p>
<p>Brazil suggested, <em>inter alia, </em>having one framing dialogue for each element of the global stocktake’s scope during the technical/analytical phase. Saudi Arabia, for the Arab Group, emphasized that it is premature to determine that there will be two phases. Iran, for the LMDCs, called for strengthening linkages between action and support, and identifying potential barriers to implementation.</p>
<p>On<strong></strong>sources of input, many agreed that the scientific inputs should be mainly derived from the IPCC and called for distinguishing between sources, such as the IPCC, and information. The EU called for consideration of how to manage inputs. Several parties suggested a non-exhaustive list of inputs, with many stressing the importance of information on mobilization of support. Several countries cautioned against attempting to agree to a specific list, especially for the sake of durability.</p>
<p>Considering the<strong></strong>scope of the global stocktake and its inputs, many developing countries emphasized equity, with Bolivia stressing a fair and equitable sharing of the global carbon budget, taking into account a country’s historical responsibility, ecological footprint and development and technological capacity. Solomon Islands, for the LDCs, underscored the importance of the global stocktake to determine “whether the Paris Agreement is sufficient for dealing with runaway climate change.” </p>
<p>South Africa advocated a scope that is both forward and backward looking. Some parties suggested there may be elements outside of “adaptation, mitigation and MOI and support” that should be considered.</p>
<p>On outcomes, the LMDCs suggested fostering international cooperation and AOSIS advocated integrating climate financing. AILAC and the EU emphasized driving action and greater ambition.<strong> </strong>Saudi Arabia, for the Arab Group, emphasized general principles, referencing the purpose of the global stocktake and the Convention. New Zealand cautioned against confounding “outcome” and “output.” </p>
<p>On the way forward, Brazil suggested the need for an APA agenda item on common timeframes. Additional proposals made included requesting a Secretariat’s synthesis report and technical paper, and holding an in-session technical workshop. Many said further submissions guided by more targeted questions would be useful.</p>
<p><strong>MODALITIES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE EFFECTIVE OPERATION OF THE COMMITTEE TO FACILITATE IMPLEMENTATION AND PROMOTE COMPLIANCE: </strong>This item was first considered on Monday, 7 November. Parties agreed to informal consultations co-facilitated by Janine Felson (Belize) and Peter Horne (Australia). </p>
<p>In informal consultations, parties discussed: the scope and functioning of the mechanism; national capabilities and circumstances; triggers for action by the committee; the committee’s relationship with existing arrangements and bodies; the participation of concerned parties; and the way forward.</p>
<p>On the scope and functioning, many countries, underscored the need for comprehensiveness and called for a general approach that facilitates implementation rather than imposing penalties. Antigua and Barbuda, for AOSIS, stated that, for legally-binding provisions, the committee should focus on compliance and otherwise on facilitating actions. </p>
<p>The EU stressed that the committee should be a single body with a facilitative function that helps achieve compliance. Mali, for the African Group, stressed that individual country assessments need to go in parallel with the collective assessment of progress. The US stressed the need to have effective accountability. </p>
<p>On national capacity, New Zealand suggested that all parties should be equally accountable for implementing their NDCs. Iran for the LMDCs, Chile for AILAC, and Mali for the African Group stressed the link between countries’ capacities and their ability<strong> </strong>to implement their commitments.</p>
<p>On triggers, most countries, including Iran, New Zealand, Brazil, Pakistan and the US, highlighted the committee has to be self-triggered, while other options were also proposed.</p>
<p>On the relationship with existing arrangements and bodies, parties highlighted links to the Convention’s MOI mechanisms, and the Paris Agreement’s transparency, capacity-building and global stocktake mechanisms. The EU underscored that the operation of this mechanism must be transparent and respect legal arrangements of other processes.</p>
<p>On the participation of the concerned parties, all stressed that the involved countries should be fully included in the process.</p>
<p>On the way forward, countries agreed to submissions responding to the Co-Facilitators’ questions, with many proposing specific deadlines. Several parties supported specifying modalities and procedures required for the effective operation of the committee, elaborating elements that could be addressed through such modalities and procedures, and addressing further work in the submissions. Some suggested technical papers or synthesis reports be prepared by the Secretariat or by the Co-Facilitators based on parties’ submissions. The US proposed, with many others, a workshop, opposed by the LMDCs as premature. The Gambia, for the LDCs, urged the development of a workplan at this session.</p>
<p><strong>FURTHER MATTERS RELATED TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT: </strong>This item was first considered on Monday, 7 November. Parties agreed to informal consultations, co-facilitated by APA Co-Chairs Baashan and Tyndall. </p>
<p>The informal consultations jointly addressed the three agenda sub-items on: preparing for the entry into force of the Paris Agreement; preparing for the convening of CMA 1; taking stock of progress made by the subsidiary and constituted bodies in relation to their mandated work under the Paris Agreement and Section III of Decision 1/CP.21, in order to promote and facilitate coordination and coherence in the implementation of the work programme, and, if appropriate, take action, which may include recommendations. </p>
<p>Regarding the request from the COP to conduct the preparatory work so that the Adaptation Fund may serve the Paris Agreement, parties agreed to consider this at APA 1-2 under the agenda item on preparing for the convening of CMA 1.</p>
<p>On issues concerning the implementation of the Paris Agreement that had not yet been raised, Brazil identified: common timeframes for NDCs; recognition of developing countries’ adaptation efforts; initial guidance to the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism; and training, public awareness and participation. Parties identified additional “orphan issues,” eventually creating a list of nine possible matters not being addressed under Decision 1/CP.21’s work programme.</p>
<p>The EU cautioned against duplication and said some of these items could be addressed in the SBs or already have a “home” under the CMA. </p>
<p>Based on parties’ request, the Co-Chairs prepared an initial table of these “orphan issues.” Parties considered whether to provide recommendations to the COP on how or where such issues could be taken up. Several developing countries and groups sought a comprehensive arrangement for all the items in the Co-Chairs’ table, opposed by others. </p>
<p>On preparing for the convening of CMA 1, parties were supportive of taking a streamlined approach to: parties’ credentials; observer organization admission; and election of Bureau officers. </p>
<p>On taking stock of progress, South Africa, supported by China and Tuvalu, and opposed by the US, proposed consideration of modalities for biennial communications of indicative support. Switzerland suggested these modalities would fall under discussions on biennial reports (BRs).</p>
<p>On the Adaptation Fund, parties considered: the key questions to be addressed in order to complete the APA’s work; steps to be undertaken to fulfill the mandate of the APA on this matter; and linkages to consider in undertaking the APA’s work on this mandate.</p>
<p>A number of developing countries urged requesting the Adaptation Fund to serve the Paris Agreement. Various developed countries, including Australia, the EU, the US and Switzerland, for the Environmental Integrity Group, suggested this question warrants further discussion and requires consideration of, <em>inter alia</em>, lessons learned. Developing countries stressed the Adaptation Fund is already contributing to the operationalization of the Paris Agreement, and supported a procedural decision on this issue. </p>
<p>The US clarified concerns on: ensuring the governing structure includes countries not party to the Kyoto Protocol; fitting the Fund into the post-Paris financial architecture; evaluating the Fund’s effectiveness; agreeing on all sources of funding; and reviewing the safeguards policy. </p>
<p>The EU added that: the Fund is under CMP authority and no other financial institution is under the CMA’s authority; the third review of the Fund is not “business as usual”; and arrangements for the Fund’s work must be examined. He called for agreeing on a clear workplan with issues to be resolved, a timeline and an end date. </p>
<p>Tuvalu, for the LDCs, and Argentina stressed possible resolutions for legal issues raised. The G-77/China suggested the CMA can make the necessary arrangements quickly, by 2018 at the latest.</p>
<p><strong>CLOSING SESSION: </strong>On Monday, 14 November, APA Co-Chair Baashan presented, and parties adopted, conclusions (FCCC/APA/2016/L.4 and Add.1). Parties recommended two draft decisions, one to the COP and the other to the CMP. She explained that the APA Co-Chairs intend to release their informal reflections note with an overview of the outcomes of this resumed session, based on the views that parties put forward at, and expressed through their submissions for, this session.

Therefore, when necessary, at the workshop discussions about technical expert review, and facilitative, multilateral consideration of progress should take place in conjunction and/or complementary with reporting;</li>
<li>requests the APA Co-Chairs to prepare, with the support of the Secretariat, a workshop report for consideration at APA 1-3; and </li>
<li>notes that in the organization of the workshop, the APA Co-Chairs and Secretariat should recognize the linkages with other agenda items to avoid duplication of work.</li>
</ul>
<p>On agenda item 6 (matters relating to the global stocktake referred to in Paris Agreement Article 14) and its sub-items, the APA:</p>
<ul>
<li>welcomes the advice of the SBSTA on how the IPCC assessments can inform the global stocktake; and </li>

<li>takes note of possible additional matters concerning implementation of the Paris Agreement and the convening of CMA 1, which have been identified by some parties and which some parties were of the view may not yet have been addressed, as reflected in the annex to the informal note prepared, under their own responsibility, by the APA Co-Chairs of the informal consultations on agenda item 8(b), and agrees to provide this information to COP 22 for its consideration and appropriate action. </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the APA: </p>
<ul>
<li>emphasizes that, for all items on the APA agenda where there is a call for the submission of views from parties, taking into consideration guiding questions, the questions in no way restrict parties from making submissions on any aspect of the issues on the APA agenda;</li>
<li>reiterates its earlier invitation to parties and admitted observer organizations to provide information, views and proposals on any work of the APA before each of its sessions; and </li>
<li>notes that the APA Co-Chairs intend to release their informal reflections note with an overview of the outcomes of this resumed session, based on the views and ideas that parties put forward at, and expressed through their submissions for, APA 1-2.

<li>with respect to draft rules 17-21, the credentials of representatives of parties to the Paris Agreement would apply to their representatives participating in sessions of the COP and the CMA, and a single report on credentials would be submitted for approval, following established procedures, by the Bureau of the COP to the CMA; and</li>
<li>with respect to draft rules 6 and 7, organizations admitted as observers to previous sessions of the COP would be admitted to CMA 1, and a single process would be used for the admission of observer organizations to sessions of the COP and the CMA, with decisions on the admission of observer organizations being taken by the COP.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Election of Officers Other than the Chair: </strong>On Monday, 14 November, the SBI elected Zhihua Chen (China) as SBI Vice-Chair and Tuğba İçmeli (Turkey) as SBI Rapporteur.  </p>
<p><strong>REPORTING FROM AND REVIEW OF ANNEX I PARTIES TO THE CONVENTION: Status of Submission and Review of Second BRs from Annex I Parties to the Convention: </strong>On Monday, 7 November, the SBI took note of the status of submission and review of second BRs from Annex I parties (FCCC/SBI/2016/INF.9).</p>
<p><strong>Compilation and Synthesis of Second BRs from Annex I Parties to the Convention:</strong> This item (FCCC/SBI/2016/INF.10, Add.1 and Add.1/Corr.1) was first considered on Monday, 7 November. Parties agreed to informal consultations co-facilitated by Anne Rasmussen (Samoa) and Helen Plume (New Zealand).</p>
<p>In informal consultations on the draft COP decision text, Co-Facilitator Plume elaborated on the differences between options: welcoming the compilation and synthesis of BR2s from Annex I parties; containing specific information that draws from the compilation and synthesis; and containing general information on the compilation and synthesis.</p>
<p>Parties expressed support for the first and second options, but could not agree. Explaining she had consulted with the SBI Chair on the way forward, Co-Facilitator Plume noted there was no consensus on the matter and that this sub-item would be forwarded to SBI 46.</p>
<p>On Friday, 11 November, the SBI adopted procedural conclusions. SBI Chair Chruszczow said he would report to the COP that the SBI could not reach substantive conclusions on this item.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome: </em></strong>In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2016/L.26), the SBI agrees to continue consideration of this item at SBI 46.</p>
<p><strong>Revision of the “Guidelines for the Preparation of NCs by Annex I Parties to the Convention, Part II: UNFCCC Reporting Guidelines on NCs”: </strong>This item was first considered on Monday, 7 November, and subsequently in consultations led by the SBI Chair Chruszczow with interested parties.</p>
<p>On Monday, 14 November, SBI Chair Chruszczow noted that the revised guidelines are “nearly ready,” but “the outstanding issue” on paragraph 71 (on communication of the information in the guidelines), on encouraging submitting an English translation, remained unresolved.</p>
<p>Many parties expressed regret that the revised guidelines had not been agreed. Several parties, including New Zealand, the US, Norway and Switzerland, expressed their intention to voluntarily apply the revised guidelines or consider including some of the guidelines’ elements, in their NC7s.</p>
<p>The Russian Federation said applying the draft guiding principles would not ensure transparency, consistency and comparability of NCs and advocated applying only adopted principles. On Monday, 14 November, the SBI adopted conclusions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome: </em></strong>In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2016/L.42), the SBI agrees to continue consideration of the outstanding issue on the draft guidelines contained in document FCCC/SBI/2016/8, Annex I, paragraph 71.</p>
<p><strong>Report on National GHG Inventory Data from Annex I Parties to the Convention for the Period 1990-2014: </strong>On Monday, 7 November, the SBI took note of the report (FCCC/SBI/2016/19).</p>

<p><strong>REPORTING FROM NON-ANNEX I PARTIES: Work of the Consultative Group of Experts (CGE): </strong>This item (FCCC/SBI/2016/15, 16 and 17) was first considered on Monday, 7 November. Parties agreed to informal consultations co-facilitated by Anne Rasmussen (Samoa) and Helen Plume (New Zealand). </p>
<p>In informal consultations, parties considered, <em>inter alia</em>, a draft COP decision on the review of the CGE, agreeing to “consider” rather than “initiate” a review at SBI 48.</p>
<p>On Friday, 11 November, the SBI adopted conclusions and forwarded a draft decision and draft conclusions for consideration by the COP. On Thursday, 17 November, the COP adopted the decision and conclusions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome: </em></strong>In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2016/L.28), the SBI takes note of the progress made by the CGE in implementing its 2016 workplan, with regard to, <em>inter alia</em>, training programmes, workshops and materials, including e-learning courses, webinars and an online platform. The SBI also takes note of the estimated budgetary implications of supporting the implementation of the work of the CGE in 2017-2018 and invites multilateral programmes and organizations to collaborate with the CGE, as appropriate, in the provision of support to non-Annex I parties for preparing their NCs and Biennial Update Reports (BURs).</p>
<p>In its decision (FCCC/SBI/2016/L.28/Add.1), the COP:</p>
<ul>
<li>decides that the mandate and ToR of the CGE as contained in Decision 19/CP.19 and the annex thereto shall remain unchanged; </li>
<li>requests SBI 48 to consider a review of the term and mandate, including the ToR, of the CGE with a view to recommending a draft decision thereon for consideration and adoption by COP 24; and</li>
<li>requests the Secretariat to facilitate the actions of the CGE called for above, subject to the availability of financial resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2016/L.28/Add.2), the COP invites a representative of non-Annex I parties not represented by the constituencies referred to in Decision 3/CP.8, annex, paragraph 3, on the membership of the CGE, to continue to participate in the group’s work in an observer capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Provision of Financial and Technical Support: </strong>This item (FCCC/SBI/2016/INF.17 and INF.18, FCCC/CP/2016/6, Add.1 and Add.2) was first considered on Monday, 7 November. Parties agreed to informal consultations co-facilitated by Anne Rasmussen (Samoa) and Helen Plume (New Zealand). </p>
<p>During informal consultations, parties discussed the operationalization of the Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT), including that CBIT “efforts” will be included in the next GEF replenishment, and recognized the challenges non-Annex I parties face in submitting BURs.</p>
<p>On Friday, 11 December, the SBI adopted conclusions. </p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome: </em></strong>In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2016/L.33), the SBI, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>welcomes the information provided by the GEF in its report to COP 22 on: the establishment of the CBIT, including its programming and implementation modalities and the voluntary contributions pledged by several countries; the financial support provided for non-Annex I parties’ preparation of NCs and BURs; and the Global Support Programme for Preparation of NCs and BURs by non-Annex I parties, especially regarding the development and implementation of the 2016 work programme thereof;</li>
<li>recommends that the COP request the GEF to continue providing the information referred to above in its annual reports;</li>
<li>notes with appreciation the successful efforts of the GEF to take swift action in the establishment of the CBIT through voluntary contributions;</li>
<li>encourages the GEF, subject to the availability of financial resources in the CBIT Trust Fund, to approve the first set of CBIT projects as early as possible and also encourages developing countries to submit project proposals to access financial resources from the CBIT Trust Fund;</li>
<li>while recognizing the challenges that non-Annex I parties face in submitting their BURs in a timely manner, further notes that, as at 9 November 2016, there were many outstanding submissions of BURs from non-Annex I parties, and, recalling Decision 2/CP.17, paragraph 41(a), which states that non-Annex I parties, consistent with their capabilities and the level of support provided for reporting, should submit their first BUR by December 2014, encourages non-Annex I parties that have not yet completed and submitted their first BUR to do so as soon as possible; and</li>
<li>recalling the request of non-Annex I parties for further technical support aimed at improving their domestic capacity to facilitate continuity in meeting their reporting requirements, encourages parties included in Annex II to the Convention, and other developed country parties in a position to do so, to provide financial resources to enable the Secretariat to continue responding to that request.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary Reports on the Technical Analysis of Non-Annex I Parties’ BURs: </strong>On Monday, 7 November, the SBI took note of the summary reports (FCCC/SBI/ICA/2015/TASR.1/AND, and FCCC/SBI/ICA/2016/TASR.1/ARG, COL, CRI, LBN, MEX and PRY) finalized in the period 1 March-30 September 2016.</p>
<p><strong>DEVELOPMENT OF MODALITIES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE OPERATION AND USE OF A PUBLIC REGISTRY REFERRED TO IN PARIS AGREEMENT ARTICLE 4.12: </strong>This item was first considered on Monday, 7 November. Parties agreed to informal consultations co-facilitated by Madeleine Diouf Sarr (Senegal) and Gertraud Wollansky (Austria).</p>
<p>During the informal consultations, parties differed primarily on the workplan for this item going forward, with two groups of developing countries calling for further exchange of views, while awaiting finalization of the APA’s related work on NDCs. In addition, one party urged for procedural conclusions only.</p>
<p>Some developing and developed countries advocated calling for party submissions, while several developing countries opposed, saying this would be premature, as the scope of work and procedural next steps should be defined first. </p>
<p>On the Secretariat’s efforts to improve the interim registry, parties debated a suggestion for the Secretariat to maintain and improve the registry “on the basis of suggestions received from its users,” ultimately preferring to state “as appropriate” instead.</p>
<p>On parties’ work at SBI 45, one group of developing countries opposed referencing a public registry “for NDCs,” but in the case that reference to “NDCs” was not deleted, preferred “NDCs referred to in Article 3 of the Paris Agreement,” rather than “in Article 4” (mitigation).</p>
<p>On reflecting the linkages with other SBI and APA work, some developed countries opposed referencing ensuring coherence and avoiding duplication, and parties ultimately agreed to use language from the SBI 44 conclusions.</p>
<p>On Friday, 11 November, the SBI adopted conclusions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome: </em></strong>In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2016/L.35), the SBI, <em>inter alia</em>, takes note of the views exchanged by parties at the session on the modalities and procedures for the operation and use of the public registry as referred to in Decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 29, including on the linkages of its work under this agenda item to the work under SBI 45 agenda item 6 (development of modalities and procedures for the operation and use of a public registry referred to in Paris Agreement Article 7.12), and to the work of the APA. </p>
<p>The SBI also agrees to continue its consideration of this matter at SBI 46.</p>
<p><strong>DEVELOPMENT OF MODALITIES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE OPERATION AND USE OF A PUBLIC REGISTRY REFERRED TO IN PARIS AGREEMENT ARTICLE 7.12: </strong>This item was first considered on Monday, 7 November. Parties agreed to informal consultations co-facilitated by Madeleine Diouf Sarr (Senegal) and Gertraud Wollansky (Austria). </p>
<p>During informal consultations, parties focused primarily on the nature of this agenda item and the workplan going forward. Two developing country groups supported procedural conclusions and, opposed by several developed country parties, underlined their preference that this agenda item be merged with SBI agenda item 5 (development of modalities and procedures for the operation and use of a public registry referred to in Paris Agreement Article 4.12). </p>
<p>Many parties noted the interlinkages among adaptation, mitigation and APA discussions, with some advocating postponing substantive discussions on what the registry will look like until the APA’s work has produced further guidance for adaptation communications.  </p>
<p>One developed country party noted parties have flexibility to submit, for instance, an NDC entirely about adaptation with mitigation co-benefits, as well as the option of not submitting an adaptation communication. One party said the SBI conclusions could request the Secretariat to assess the cost and resource implications of developing two registries.</p>
<p>Some parties, opposed by others, characterized requesting submissions as “premature.” Unable to agree on intersessional work or next steps, parties agreed to continue consideration of this matter at SBI 46. </p>
<p>On Friday, 11 November, the SBI adopted conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2016/L.36). Saudi Arabia recalled that the Co-Facilitators were asked to report to the SBI Chair that, due to linkages between this SBI agenda item and item 5, some parties had requested that the two items be merged. SBI Chair Chruszczow noted the concern and said it would be taken into account in the preparation of the next session’s provisional agenda.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome: </em></strong>In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2016/L.36), the SBI, <em>inter alia</em>, takes note of: the views expressed by parties during the session on this matter, including on the existing or potential linkages to SBI 45 agenda item 5; the continued work of the Secretariat on the interim registry; the web page maintained by the Secretariat on undertakings in adaptation planning; and the work of the APA. </p>
<p>The SBI also agrees to continue its consideration of this matter at SBI 46.</p>
<p><strong>MATTERS RELATING TO THE MECHANISMS UNDER THE KYOTO PROTOCOL: Review of the Modalities and Procedures for the CDM: </strong>On Monday, 7 November, the SBI forwarded this item (FCCC/SBI/2016/INF.16) to informal consultations co-facilitated by Hlobsile Sikhosana-Shongwe (Swaziland) and Karoliina Anttonen (Finland). During informal consultations, throughout the week, parties considered a draft text provided by the Secretariat.</p>
<p>On CDM programmes of activities, one group of parties suggested methodologies may be developed for programmes of activities, and “top-down methodologies” be developed for underrepresented sectors. Another group suggested text reflecting that micro-scale activities under programmes of activities can apply micro-scale additionality and may demonstrate the applicability of micro-scale thresholds at the unit level. Several parties opposed these proposals.</p>
<p>On a proposal to encourage designated national authorities (DNAs) to communicate relevant information on the CDM to the public, some parties favored deletion, while others suggested further work.</p>
<p>On programmes of activities and roles of DNAs to supplement the CDM modalities and procedures, parties could not reach an agreement and engaged in lengthy discussions on postponing this agenda item. </p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome:</em></strong> On Monday, 14 November, SBI Chair Chruszczow noted conclusions had not been reached and negotiations would continue at SBI 46. </p>
<p><strong>Procedures, Mechanisms and Institutional Arrangements for Appeals against Decisions of the CDM Executive Board (EB): </strong>On Monday, 7 November, the item was forwarded for informal consultations co-facilitated by Karoliina Anttonen (Finland). On Friday, 11 November, the SBI adopted conclusions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome</em>:</strong> In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2016/L.30), the SBI agrees to continue its consideration of this matter at SBI 50 on the basis of, <em>inter alia</em>, the draft text contained in document FCCC/SBI/2012/33/Add.1.</p>
<p><strong>Report of the Administrator of the International Transaction Log (ITL) under the Kyoto Protocol:</strong> On Monday, 7 November, the SBI took note of the report (FCCC/SBI/2016/INF.20).</p>

<p><strong>REPORT OF THE WIM EXCOM: </strong>This item (FCCC/SB/2016/3) was first considered on Monday, 7 November, and subsequently in joint SBSTA/SBI informal consultations co-facilitated by Beth Lavender (Canada) and Alf Wills (South Africa).</p>
<p>In informal consultations, parties discussed the report of the WIM Executive Committee (ExCom) and the review of the WIM separately and agreed to have separate decisions for the issues.</p>
<p>Many parties welcomed the report of the WIM ExCom, and noted the considerable work achieved by the WIM ExCom during its workplan. Parties’ views diverged on encouraging submissions on possible activities under each strategic workstream of the indicative framework for the five-year workplan. </p>
<p>One developed country party suggested removing the paragraph while two developing country groups proposed including views on the workstream to enhance the mobilization and securing of financial support from developed to developing countries in the submissions. Another group suggested a synthesis report of these submissions. </p>
<p>Some parties noted that there is a placeholder for financial support in the five-year rolling workplan, to which one developing country group responded that the other placeholders are for items such as emerging issues, which are different in nature from the provision of financial support.</p>
<p>On the review of the WIM, parties agreed that the review should consider the structure, effectiveness and mandate of the WIM as mandated by COP 19. One group suggested assessing gaps, needs and challenges in delivering on the mandate, and making recommendations on how to strengthen work over the next five years. Some proposed also reviewing the structure and mandate in the context of the WIM serving the Paris Agreement, with one group suggesting separating the “backward-looking” elements of the review from the “forward-looking” elements that will consider the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, 15 November, the SBI adopted conclusions, and forwarded two draft decisions for consideration by the COP. On Thursday, 17 November, the COP adopted both decisions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcomes:</em></strong> In its decision (FCCC/SB/2016/L.8) on the WIM, the COP, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>requests the ExCom to continue to implement activities from its initial two-year workplan;</li>
<li>approves the indicative framework for the five-year rolling workplan of the ExCom as the basis for developing corresponding activities, starting at the first meeting of the ExCom in 2017, taking into account relevant inputs provided by parties and relevant organizations;</li>
<li>requests the ExCom to include in its five-year rolling workplan a strategic workstream to guide the implementation of the WIM’s function of enhancing action and support, including finance, technology and capacity building, to address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, as provided for in Decision 2/CP.19 (the WIM); and</li>
<li>requests the ExCom to include in its five-year rolling workplan relevant work for advancing the operationalization of the mandates ensuing from Decision 1/CP.21, paragraphs 48 (establishing a clearinghouse for risk transfer) and 49 (establishing a task force to avert, minimize, address displacement).</li>
</ul>
<p>In its decision (FCCC/SB/2016/L.9), on review of the WIM, the COP recommends that:</p>
<ul>
<li>there be a process to periodically review the WIM and that reviews take place no more than five years apart; </li>
<li>the next review will be held in 2019, and the periodicity of future reviews be decided at that time;</li>
<li>future reviews of the WIM should consider, <em>inter alia</em>, progress on the implementation of the workplan of the WIM ExCom as well as its long-term vision that guides ways in which the WIM may be enhanced and strengthened, as appropriate;</li>
<li>the SBs finalize ToRs for each review of the WIM at least six months prior to the review being undertaken;</li>
<li>the SBs take into consideration inputs and submissions from parties and relevant organizations, as appropriate, when developing the ToR for the review;</li>
<li>as an input to the review in 2019, a technical paper be prepared by the Secretariat elaborating the sources of financial support, as provided through the Financial Mechanism, for addressing loss and damage as described in relevant decisions, as well as modalities for accessing such support;</li>
<li>the technical paper include an elaboration of finance available for addressing loss and damage as described in relevant decisions, outside the financial mechanism, as well as the modalities for accessing it; and</li>
<li>the Secretariat, assisted by the WIM ExCom, determine the scope of the technical paper, with a view to making the paper available to parties by SB 50 for consideration in the review of the WIM.</li>
</ul>
<p>The COP further recommends that the following activities may advance the work of the ExCom:</p>
<ul>
<li>enhancing collaboration, cooperation and partnerships with bodies, entities and work programmes, including the PCCB, within and outside the Convention; </li>
<li>considering the establishment of, as appropriate, additional expert groups, subcommittees, panels, thematic advisory groups or focused working groups to assist it in conducting its work and supporting its efforts to enhance action and support for loss and damage as provided for in Decision 2/CP.19, paragraph 5(c)(i-iii) (enhancing action and support to address loss and damage); </li>
<li>improving access to, and interaction with, relevant scientific and technical panels, bodies and expertise available to the WIM ExCom and substructures over time, including by, <em>inter alia</em>, inviting relevant organizations at all levels and scientific research organizations with scientific expertise relevant to loss and damage to ensure that the best available science is highlighted in the work of the WIM; and</li>
<li>inviting interested parties to establish a loss and damage contact point through their respective UNFCCC national focal point, with a view to enhancing the implementation of approaches to address loss and damage associated with the adverse impacts of climate change at the national level.</li>

<p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL MATTERS: </strong>These items were first considered on Monday, 7 November. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Espinosa highlighted concerns about the sustainability of the Secretariat’s workload given a decline in voluntary contributions and encouraged parties to pay their contributions for 2017 as soon as possible. The agenda sub-items on budget performance for the biennium 2016-2017, audit reports and financial statements for 2015, and other financial matters were forwarded for back-to-back discussions in a contact group chaired by Kunihiko Shimada (Japan).   </p>
<p><strong>Budget Performance for the Biennium 2016-2017: </strong>This item<strong> </strong>(FCCC/SBI/2016/13, INF.15 and INF.19) was first considered on Monday, 7 November. During the contact group and informal consultations, parties considered draft COP decision text on budget performance for the biennium 2016-2017, audit reports and financial statements for 2015, and other financial matters.</p>
<p>On budget performance, parties discussed, <em>inter alia</em> ¸ New Zealand ’s proposal to highlight outstanding core budget contributions as a “significant problem ,” and require the Secretariat to follow up with parties and report back to SBI 46 with a proposal on ways to increase the predictability of cash flows . </p>
<p>Parties debated, <em>inter alia</em>: calling on parties to make their contributions for 2017 in a timely manner; requesting the Secretariat to follow up with countries with outstanding contributions on why payment has not been made; urging “further contributions,” “parties to further contribute” or “Annex II parties to further contribute” to the Trust Fund for Participation in the UNFCCC Process; expressing appreciation for contributions to the Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities; and requesting the Secretariat explore ways to increase the flexible use and prioritization of funds in this Trust Fund. </p>
<p>New Zealand, opposed by Saudi Arabia, urged parties to accept a paragraph on the revised scale of contributions for 2016-2017, given that the Secretariat would otherwise lack sufficient funding for the 2017 programme of work. </p>

<li>invites parties, observers and other stakeholders to submit, by 10 April 2017, their views on the principles and structure of the technology framework.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ISSUES RELATING TO AGRICULTURE: </strong>This item (FCCC/SBSTA/2016/INF.5 and INF.6) was first taken up by the SBSTA plenary on Monday, 7 November, and subsequently in informal consultations co-facilitated by Emmanuel Dlamini (Swaziland) and Heikki Granholm (Finland).</p>
<p>During informal consultations, parties tried to find common ground between two draft decisions proposed by two different groups of parties. Some parties noted that the draft decisions differed in how they balance mitigation and adaptation. One party identified several commonalities, including: recommending a COP decision; promoting implementation; calling for workshops and submissions; citing the need for a knowledge hub; and highlighting food security.</p>
<p>Given continued differences in opinion, one group suggested that the document parties worked on in informal informals should be transmitted to SBSTA 46 as a non-paper, mandating only parties to give input. Another party stated the document should have no status. Parties eventually agreed to forward draft procedural conclusions to the SBSTA, with several groups and parties intervening to express their disappointment at the lack of a substantive COP decision on this item.</p>
<p>On Monday, 14 November, the SBSTA adopted conclusions. </p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome:</em></strong> In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2016/L.23), the SBSTA agrees to continue its consideration of this agenda item at SBSTA 46.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Advice on How the Assessments of the IPCC Can Inform the Global Stocktake Referred to in Paris Agreement Article 14:</strong> This item was first considered on Monday, 7 November. Parties agreed to informal consultations co-facilitated by Frank McGovern (Ireland) and Patience Damptey (Mali).</p>
<p>During informal consultations, parties focused particularly on how to provide tailored guidance to the IPCC without overstepping their mandate. </p>
<p>On providing guidance, three developing countries called for elaborating more carefully on what is needed from the IPCC, noting its reports and assessments contain more than is necessary for the global stocktake. They suggested inputs from the IPCC on: the aggregate effect of NDCs in light of the 1.5°C limit; impacts on natural systems; avoided impacts; scientific approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptation; scientific approaches to assessing climate finance; and progress towards the global adaptation goal.</p>
<p>In response, several developed and developing countries cautioned this may be too prescriptive for the agenda item’s mandate to focus on “how” the IPCC assessments can inform the stocktake. One added that specific inputs will be decided by the IPCC in its scoping process.</p>
<p>Responding to several countries’ support for requesting the IPCC to align its assessment cycles with those of the global stocktake, many countries noted the independence of the IPCC, adding that the Panel is already considering how to align its work with the Paris Agreement’s provisions. </p>
<p>On Monday, 14 November, the SBSTA adopted conclusions. </p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome: </em></strong>In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2016/L.24), the SBSTA, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>acknowledges that the products of the IPCC assessment cycles will be key inputs to the global stocktake and will provide the best available scientific knowledge that is policy-relevant but not policy-prescriptive, providing an integrated scientific, technical and socio-economic perspective;</li>
<li>notes that the forthcoming products of the sixth IPCC assessment cycle will be key inputs to the first global stocktake in 2023;</li>
<li>encourages the IPCC to pay particular attention to the first global stocktake when scoping its sixth assessment report, taking into account that the global stocktake will assess collective progress towards achieving the Paris Agreement’s purpose and long-term goals in a comprehensive and facilitative manner, considering mitigation, adaptation, and MOI and support, in the light of equity and the best available science;</li>
<li>welcomes the IPCC’s decision to request its Secretariat to “prepare proposals for aligning the work of the IPCC during its seventh assessment report with the needs of the global stocktake foreseen under the Paris Agreement and to submit these proposals for consideration at a plenary session of the IPCC no later than 2018,” and encourages the IPCC to continue this consideration, with a view to ensuring that the global stocktake is always informed in a timely manner by the best available science; and</li>
<li>invites the IPCC to consider any outcome from the global stocktake, including possible scientific information gaps, that the IPCC views as relevant to inform its future assessment. </li>
</ul>
<p>The SBSTA also provides the following advice on how the assessments of the IPCC can inform the global stocktake, recognizing that identification of the sources of input for the global stocktake will be undertaken by the APA: </p>
<ul>
<li>lessons can be learned from past experience; dialogue between IPCC experts and parties on the findings of the IPCC products, enabling a focused scientific and technical exchange of information in an open and transparent manner, could be utilized; </li>
<li>convening special events, similar to the SBSTA-IPCC special event organized by the SBSTA on 18 May 2016, could be of value; </li>
<li>views emerging from the rich exchange of information between the IPCC and parties at the SBSTA-IPCC special event could be further considered; </li>
<li>inputs from the IPCC should be considered in an effective and balanced manner, as part of the overall input to the global stocktake; and </li>
<li>the SBSTA-IPCC Joint Working Group could be used to enhance communication and coordination between the SBSTA and IPCC in the context of the global stocktake.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of the Implementation of Response Measures: Improved Forum and Work Programme: </strong>During the SBSTA opening plenary on Monday, 7 November, parties agreed to establish a joint SBI/SBSTA contact group on this item (FCCC/SB/2016/INF.2 and FCCC/TP/2016/7), co-chaired by SBI Chair Chruszczow and SBSTA Chair Fuller. Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Andrei Marcu (Panama) and Nataliya Kushko (Ukraine). Discussions on this item are summarized under the SBI agenda item on the impact of the implementation of response measures (see page 28). </p>
<p><strong>Modalities, Work Programme and Functions under the Paris Agreement of the Forum on the Impact of the Implementation of Response Measures:</strong> This sub-item was considered jointly with the improved forum and work programme, summarized under the SBI agenda item on the impact of the implementation of response measures (see page 28).</p>
<p><strong>Matters Relating to Protocol Article 2.3 (Adverse Effects of Policies and Measures): </strong>This sub-item was considered jointly with the improved forum and work programme, summarized under the SBI agenda item on the impact of the implementation of response measures (see page 28).</p>
<p><strong>METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES UNDER THE CONVENTION: GHG Data Interface: </strong>This item was first considered on Monday, 7 November. Parties agreed to conduct informal consultations, co-facilitated by Takeshi Enoki (Japan) and Thapelo Letete (South Africa). The SBSTA could not reach agreement and SBSTA 46 will continue consideration of this sub-item.</p>
<p><strong>Bunker Fuels: </strong>This item (FCCC/SBSTA/2016/MISC.5) was first considered on Monday, 7 November. SBSTA Chair Fuller proposed, and parties agreed, that he would conduct informal consultations.</p>
<p>ICAO highlighted the agreement on the CORSIA. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) reported a new requirement for ships to record and report data on their fuel oil consumption.</p>
<p>India, on behalf of many developing countries and coalitions, stressed that mechanisms developed under ICAO and IMO should align with the principles of the Convention and COP decisions. Japan said IMO and ICAO are suitable forums to address emissions from international aviation and shipping. The US and Singapore welcomed the adoption of CORSIA and the IMO’s amendment of the MARPOL Convention on fuel consumption by ships, with Singapore stressing the need to develop long-term measures on shipping emissions. </p>
<p>On Monday, 14 November, the SBSTA adopted conclusions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome:</em></strong> In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2016/L.25), the SBSTA, <em>inter alia</em>, takes note of the information received from and results reported by the ICAO and IMO Secretariats, and invites the ICAO and IMO Secretariats to continue to report, at future SBSTA sessions, on their ongoing work on relevant issues.</p>
<p><strong>METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES UNDER THE KYOTO PROTOCOL: Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) under Protocol Articles 3.3 and 3.4, and under the CDM: </strong>The SBSTA first considered this item (FCCC/SBSTA/2016/INF.7) on Monday, 7 November, and agreed to informal consultations co-facilitated by Maya Hunt (New Zealand) and José Antonio Prado (Chile). </p>
<p>In informal consultations, a party distributed a non-paper with substantive conclusions, <em>inter alia</em>, acknowledging that although the modalities for afforestation and reforestation could be, or are, technically applicable to certain revegetation activities, implementation of revegetation project activities in the remaining time of the Protocol’s second commitment period would be difficult. </p>
<p>Characterizing this as a “significant concession,” the party expressed flexibility on closing the agenda item if substantive conclusions were adopted that recognize certain revegetation activities, to avoid this becoming a “zombie item.” Many supported the non-paper as a basis for negotiations, with some developed countries saying it would constitute a package that would include closing this item, which several developing countries opposed.</p>
<p>On Monday, 14 November, the SBSTA adopted conclusions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome:</em></strong> In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2016/L.20), the SBSTA agrees to continue consideration of this issue at SBSTA 46.</p>
<p><strong>CCS in Geological Formations as CDM Projects and Activities:</strong> This item was first considered on Monday, 7 November. SBSTA Chair Fuller proposed, and parties agreed, that he would conduct informal consultations with interested parties.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>MATTERS RELATING TO PARIS AGREEMENT ARTICLE 6: </strong>All three sub-items under this item were first considered on Monday, 7 November. Parties agreed to informal consultations co-facilitated by Hugh Sealy (Maldives) and Kelley Kizzier (EU).</p>
<p>In informal consultations, parties discussed ideas for the work programme and draft conclusions for all three sub-items. Several developed countries, supported by two groups of developing countries, suggested requesting focused submissions on the elements of the guidance that would need to be developed, requesting a synthesis of the submissions from the Secretariat and the convening of a workshop on that basis. </p>
<p>While there was strong support for focused submissions, many developing countries expressed hesitation at having the Secretariat synthesize views or produce a technical paper. One group worried this would eliminate ideas too early. Several developing countries also rejected the idea of a workshop, with one cautioning it could lead to parallel discussions.</p>
<p><strong>Guidance on Cooperative Approaches Referred to in Paris Agreement Article 6.2: </strong>In informal consultations, parties reacted to guiding questions proposed by the Co-Facilitators on: options for ensuring environmental integrity and sustainable development; functioning of the corresponding adjustment; reach of the guidance; and managing relationships between Paris Agreement Articles 6.2 and 6.4, and between Articles 6.2 and 4.13 (accounting for NDCs). Several parties considered the corresponding adjustment too technical an issue for discussion at SBSTA 45. </p>
<p>On guidance for what can be transferred, many suggested keeping the scope open. Others called for centralized governance and appropriate institutions under the CMA.</p>
<p>On relationships, one party suggested that the exchange of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs) should happen under Paris Agreement Article 6.2, while ITMOs could be generated by any mechanism, including that established by Article 6.4.</p>
<p>On Monday, 14 November, the SBSTA adopted conclusions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome: </em></strong>In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2016/L.28), the SBSTA, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>invites parties to submit, by 17 March 2017, their views on, <em>inter alia</em>, the elements to be addressed, including their operationalization, in the guidance referred to in Paris Agreement Article 6.2, overarching issues, and relationships between Article 6.2 and other provisions of the Paris Agreement, the Convention and its related legal instruments, as relevant;</li>
<li>requests the Secretariat to organize a roundtable discussion among parties based on the submissions, in conjunction with SBSTA 46, while ensuring broad participation of developing and developed countries; and</li>
<li>agrees to continue its consideration of this matter at SBSTA 46.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rules, Modalities and Procedures for the Mechanism Established by Paris Agreement Article 6.4: </strong>In informal consultations, parties considered clarifying questions from the Co-Facilitators on: the impact of all parties having NDCs on the operation of a centralized mechanism; additionality; governance; how to deliver overall mitigation; the sequencing of the development of project rules and defining scopes of other activities; and how to use the experiences from existing mechanisms.</p>
<p>On additionality, one party suggested that this provision is about enabling new projects that would not have taken place without Article 6.4, not activities that are already planned within a country’s NDC. Another highlighted that additionality is inherently linked to environmental integrity.</p>
<p>Parties expressed strong support for centralized governance, and for enhancing and building on experience from the CDM and JI. One party noted interlinkages with the article’s other provisions, especially in the context of not double counting units.</p>
<p>On sequencing, one party advocated prioritizing project-based rules and then building from there.</p>
<p>On Monday, 14 November, the SBSTA adopted conclusions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome: </em></strong>In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2016/L.29), the SBSTA, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>invites parties to submit, by 17 March 2017, their views on, <em>inter alia</em>, the elements to be addressed, including their operationalization, in the rules, modalities and procedures for the mechanism established by Paris Agreement Article 6.4, overarching issues, and relationships between Articles 6.4-6.6, and other provisions of the Paris Agreement, the Convention and its related legal instruments, as relevant;</li>
<li>requests the Secretariat to organize a roundtable discussion among parties based on the submissions, in conjunction with SBSTA 46, while ensuring broad participation of developing and developed countries; and</li>
<li>agrees to continue its consideration of this matter at SBSTA 46.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Work Programme under the Framework for Non-Market Approaches Referred to in Paris Agreement Article 6.8:</strong> In informal consultations, parties responded to guiding questions relating to whether governance, quantification, accounting and international cooperation, respectively, are relevant for non-market approaches.</p>
<p>Some highlighted the importance of governance in the context of tracking non-market approaches’ contributions to NDCs. Many parties underlined that, where possible, quantification will be useful, with some suggesting existing reporting channels and GHG inventories can serve this purpose.</p>
<p>One party noted that accounting is not a necessity or obligation, but that procedures and guidelines for voluntary use would be useful. Some parties pointed to the possible synergies and overlaps with Paris Agreement Articles 6.2 and 6.4, with one group cautioning that these overlaps call for accounting to avoid double-counting. </p>
<p>Parties expressed views on the national nature of non-market approaches, with many pointing to areas where international cooperation can augment national action. </p>
<p>On institutional arrangements, one group suggested the work programme include workshops, with other parties suggesting: creating a clearinghouse; grouping non-market approaches by type; and undertaking a mapping exercise of approaches.</p>
<p>On Monday, 14 November, the SBSTA adopted conclusions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome: </em></strong>In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2016/L.30), the SBSTA, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>invites parties to submit, by 17 March 2017, their views on, <em>inter alia</em>, the elements to be addressed, including their operationalization, in the decision on the work programme on the framework for non-market approaches to sustainable development defined in Paris Agreement Article 6.9, overarching issues, and relationships between Articles 6.8 and 6.9, and other provisions of the Paris Agreement, the Convention and its related legal instruments, as relevant;</li>
<li>requests the Secretariat to organize a roundtable discussion among parties based on the submissions, in conjunction with SBSTA 46, while ensuring broad participation of developing and developed countries; and</li>
<li>agrees to continue its consideration of this matter at SBSTA 46.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MODALITIES FOR THE ACCOUNTING OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES PROVIDED AND MOBILIZED THROUGH PUBLIC INTERVENTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARIS AGREEMENT ARTICLE 9.7:</strong> This issue (FCCC/SBSTA/2016/MISC.3) was first considered by the SBSTA on Monday, 7 November, where it was forwarded to a contact group, co-facilitated by Rafael da Soler (Brazil) and Outi Honkatukia (Finland).</p>
<p>In the contact group, parties discussed, <em>inter alia</em>, whether the mandate of the group is limited to modalities for resources from developed to developing countries only. The Philippines, for the G-77/China, highlighted linkages with other issues, including transparency and the global stocktake, and called for examining definitions. Chile, for AILAC, called for defining public financing.</p>
<p>On session outcomes, several countries supported a draft decision. The EU and Switzerland, among others, stressed the need for clarity on the way forward to COP 24. The US inquired about other possible vehicles for capturing progress.</p>
<p>A summary of the in-session workshop on this issue is available at http://enb.iisd.org/vol12/enb12680e.html. </p>
<p>During informal consultations, parties commented on the draft conclusions and decision proposed by the Co-Chairs. Belize, for AOSIS, supported by Costa Rica, Malawi and the Philippines, proposed amendments, including, <em>inter alia</em>, encouraging UN specialized funds and agencies to support the development of modalities with wide participation by, and through technical meetings among, experts; and ensuring that the modalities are developed in time to be integrated into the transparency framework.</p>
<p>On Monday, 14 November, the SBSTA adopted conclusions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome: </em></strong>In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2016/L.27), the SBSTA, <em>inter alia</em>: </p>

<h2><strong>A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE MARRAKECH CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE</strong></h2>
<p>COP 22 delegates returned to the city where 15 years ago they adopted the Marrakech Accords, the rulebook for the Kyoto Protocol, with a similar task at hand. Marrakech again became the site of technical negotiations aimed at operationalizing a treaty that the world hopes can combat global climate change amid ever-more alarming and certain evidence of its extent and effects. And, as before, US domestic politics created uncertainty on the ability of a treaty still in its infancy to achieve these necessary goals. </p>
<p>In many ways, the world is politically and economically very different than it was 15 years ago. The Paris Agreement has entered into force, providing certainty to parties’ work on the rulebook and eliminating the possibility that a small “gang” of countries can demand concessions and weaken the treaty’s operational rules in exchange for their ratifications. The US is no longer the world’s largest emitter, meaning others can become climate leaders. Economically, the price and capacity of renewable energy rival fossil fuels in several developed and developing countries. Once China’s national cap and trade system commences in March 2017, 60% of the world’s gross domestic product will include a carbon price. During COP 22, 360 businesses, including global brands such as Nike and Starbucks, urged US President-elect Donald Trump to power the US economy with low-carbon energy. Today, governments, business leaders and investors routinely make climate-friendly decisions for the sake of their portfolios, if not the planet.</p>
<p>Occurring at the crest of this wave of momentum, COP 22 was perceived to have two tasks, each with a different audience. To the outside world, delegates had to demonstrate that the UNFCCC could contribute to the momentum generated post-Paris by the actions of non-state actors, as well as other international processes, including the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol that phases out the powerful greenhouse gas hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and the International Civil Aviation Organization’s new offsetting mechanism for carbon emissions from the international aviation sector. Internally, delegates had considerable technical work at hand, to build a foundation for the accelerated completion of the modalities, procedures and guidelines that will make the Paris Agreement implementable. This brief analysis considers the extent to which COP 22 achieved these two tasks.</p>
<p><strong><em>CARRYING THE MOMENTUM</em></strong></p>
<p>After a historically rapid entry into force of the Paris Agreement, many outside the process looked to COP 22 to maintain the momentum. Many anticipated CMA 1 as a moment of celebration. Indeed, during the pre-COP meeting, parties collectively worried that connotations of terms such as “suspend” and “adjourn” would send the signal that the UNFCCC is halting, rather than making progress.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to show significant progress when relatively bland technical work is at hand. COP 22 rose to the challenge, by creating a sense of urgency and accountability for the development of a rulebook that will make the Paris Agreement implementable from day one. The COP and CMA decisions both set 2018 as the deadline for the rulebook. This was a year earlier than many envisaged when they were in Paris, but a year later than coalitions such as the LDCs believed necessary for some parts of the rulebook. The LDCs advocated for adoption of decisions as they are ready, in order to avoid separate parts of the rulebook from being tied together in a package deal.</p>
<p>Parties also agreed to add to their workload by considering other items, such as the Adaptation Fund’s role, as necessary components of the post-Paris climate regime, if not its rulebook. While delegates reached agreement on a fairly ambitious work programme and timeline for technical work, most of the high-level signals of commitment and energy came from outside the technical negotiations.</p>
<p>The Moroccan Presidency seemed determined to ensure that COP 22 would not be overly mundane, especially following the charismatic Parisian COP. Technical work concluded early in the second week, to the consternation of some who felt that the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Working Group for the Paris Agreement (APA) should enjoy the full two weeks of negotiating time that other <em>ad hoc </em>working groups traditionally received. Concluding this work, however, cleared the schedule for the many high-level events planned by the Moroccan hosts. </p>
<p>The Presidency invited and hosted approximately 50 heads of state and government during the high-level segment, and convened several other high-level events, including on accelerating action and on climate finance. The conference also strengthened the Global Climate Action Agenda, which dates back to 2014 and is designed to catalyze and showcase pre-2020 action by state and non-state actors. It did so by launching the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, which aims at concretizing the Agenda and providing a roadmap for action from 2017 to 2020.</p>
<p>Throughout the second week, quiet informal consultations on the Presidency-led Marrakech Action Proclamation continued in the background. Several delegates saw this political document as a distraction, particularly as they continued to diminish its content through multiple rounds of consultations and revisions from four pages to a single page document essentially restating the least controversial elements of the Paris Agreement. Many understood the Presidency’s desire for an outcome beyond disparate announcements and a technical work programme, yet some small delegations favored technical work over ministerial engagements.</p>
<p>Following the US Presidential election, these high-level forums also served as important platforms for states to signal their resolve to move forward, preferably with the US still engaged in the multilateral climate process. The election of Donald Trump, who advocated stronger climate action in 2009 and also promised to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2016, cast a shadow of uncertainty over the future of the Paris Agreement. The words “unstoppable” and “irreversible” became common qualifiers to describe climate action and momentum articulated by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, at his last COP, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa, at her first COP, and US Special Envoy for Climate Change Jonathan Pershing, at his 22nd, and hopefully not final, COP.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, the announcement by US President George W. Bush that the US would not ratify the Kyoto Protocol dealt a blow to its entry into force and subsequent effectiveness. This time, many speculated that the rapid entry into force of the Paris Agreement was a quietly coordinated effort to “Trump-proof” the Paris Agreement since once the Agreement enters into force there is a three-year waiting period for any country wishing to withdraw, followed by a year before the withdrawal can take effect. Some celebrated that the Paris Agreement is secure, but others wearily noted that not withdrawing and actively engaging through implementation are very different actions. The US delegation and US Secretary of State John Kerry did their best to represent the Obama Administration, while sharing others’ uncertainty of what lies ahead for their country’s climate policy. Secretary of State Kerry had perhaps the most political room to speak, underscoring that “no one person has the right to make decisions on behalf of billions based solely on ideology.”</p>
<p>While declarations for the US to “lead or get out of the way” rung somewhat naïve in 2007, when the US signed on to negotiations for a post-Kyoto agreement, as many recognized the necessity of the involvement of the country that was then the world’s largest emitter. At COP 22 the resolve had precisely that message. With all the other significant emitters on board for the Paris Agreement, the engagement of social and economic actors, and dedication of subnational authorities, many ventured that the world could move ahead with the transformation to a low-emissions world and leave the US in the economy of the past.</p>
<p>COP 22 did much to ride and build the wave of momentum to show a united, progressive front. Disappointing for developing countries, however, was that this momentum was for post-2020 action, leaving, once again, pre-2020 action as a second act to the showier work of designing and operationalizing a new treaty. Many lamented that, “despite the Paris Agreement entering into force, the Doha Amendment from 2012 still has not.” An important part of the balance struck by the Durban mandate in 2011 was that parties would both negotiate a new agreement and enhance pre-2020 ambition under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol. For developing countries, this was a promise still undelivered.</p>
<p>There were reasons to celebrate at COP 22, including the Paris Agreement’s entry into force and many announcements of funding and action by state and non-state actors. However, some delegates worried that “lost in the festivities” was the fact that the current pledges are inadequate to stay below 2°C and bridge the estimated emissions gap of 12-14 gigatons (roughly equivalent to taking all cars in Europe off the road for 12-14 years). Announcements of US$81 million contributed to the Adaptation Fund, surpassing its fundraising target for 2016, helped, but did not fully placate calls to also close the finance gap and for equal treatment of pre-2020 and post-2020 ambition and action.</p>
<p><strong><em>WRITING THE RULEBOOK</em></strong></p>
<p>With regard to the Paris Agreement rulebook, Marrakech made a fair deal of progress. Important outcomes from the CMA included setting 2018 as the deadline for concluding the operationalization of the Agreement and rescuing the so-called “orphan issues” that had not yet been explicitly included on the agendas of the subsidiary bodies. Many parties welcomed the specific mandates given to the SBI to take up two of these orphan issues―common timeframes for NDCs and Paris Agreement Article 12 (education, training and public awareness)―in its second session in 2017. </p>
<p>Many also felt important clarity was provided on the preparations for the 2018 facilitative dialogue to take stock of collective progress towards the Paris Agreement’s long-term emissions goal and inform the preparation of NDCs, through the COP’s request to the COP 22 and 23 Presidents to undertake consultations on the organization of this dialogue and report back to COP 23.</p>
<p>There was also progress under the APA during the first week of the conference. Under the APA, informal consultations met six to seven times on each of the substantive items, namely mitigation, adaptation, transparency, global stocktake, implementation and compliance, and further matters relating to implementation. The agreed APA conclusions contain a reference to informal notes prepared by the co-facilitators of each of these discussions, capturing views expressed and, in some cases, guiding questions or elements to structure further discussions. Parties also welcomed the clear work programme set out in the APA conclusions for each item through May 2017, which includes, among other things, calls for submissions, workshops and a roundtable. For each substantive item, parties left COP 22 with homework, which many felt would enable progress to be made within, and across, all items in a balanced manner.</p>
<p>The SBI and SBSTA agreed on outcomes that advance both the institutional framework of the UN climate regime and work on the Paris Agreement rulebook, including the full operationalization of the Paris Committee on Capacity-building, which will start work in 2017, and agreement on a five-year rolling workplan for the Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) on loss and damage, and agreement for subsequent periodic reviews of the WIM, which may become important as the mechanism shifts to serve the Agreement after 2020. </p>
<p>Work under the two SBs also supported the development of the post-2020 transparency framework for action and support in at least two ways. First, meetings to analyze and review individual parties’ mitigation policies and measures convened under the two tracks currently forming the UNFCCC transparency system established in Cancún: the multilateral assessment and the facilitative sharing of views. Second, parties also made progress in SBSTA discussions on accounting modalities for information on “public climate finance,” specifically support from developed countries provided and mobilized through public interventions to developing countries. An in-session workshop held on this item and a Co-Chairs’ reflections note will provide inputs for a technical paper to take this work forward.</p>
<p>Despite unquestionable progress made on technical work, some felt Marrakech could have done more. A number of developed and developing countries expressed disappointment that the APA did not continue its discussions during the second week. However, as pointed out by many observers, some developing countries clearly expressed in a number of the APA’s informal sessions that they were not ready to “rush” on the development of the rulebook, proposing instead submissions and further discussions as their preferred way forward. While many agreed that time could have been better utilized―especially given the fact that most negotiators and technical experts stayed on through the second week―a number of participants recognized that this was perhaps the best possible outcome given the differences in view on how quickly to proceed.</p>
<p>Discussions under, and beyond, the APA in Marrakech clearly demonstrated that important political misalignments remain, particularly with regard to the careful balance struck in the Paris Agreement between its elements, the differentiation of responsibilities and the attention given to the pre- and post-2020 eras. COP 22 confirmed the expectations―and fears―of long-term observers that different interpretations allowed by the constructive ambiguity of the Paris Agreement would continue to affect the pace and sequencing of work on its rulebook. In the APA discussions on mitigation, one developing country group made it clear that it was not happy to proceed further unless the discussions capture the “full scope of the NDCs” and provide specific information on means of implementation―finance, technology and capacity-building support. Seemingly straightforward, technical discussions under the SBI whether to have one or two public registries for countries’ NDCs and adaptation communications made little progress due to calls to first advance work under the APA on adaptation communications and NDCs.</p>
<p>A number of the “roadblocks” in advancing technical discussions on the rulebook arguably derive from how the Paris Agreement resolved the issues of differentiation between developed and developing countries, and of how work in the pre-2020 period would be advanced. This latter issue is essential to developing countries who continue to worry about developed countries’ wanting to “delay” fulfilling their obligations to the post-2020 era when all countries are expected to make contributions to climate action. During the closing plenary, South Africa, speaking for the BASIC countries, stressed the need to “give equal preference to pre-2020 issues” at the next UNFCCC session, expressing concern that these issues were not adequately dealt with in Marrakech. </p>
<p>A new discussion that emerged in Marrakech was that of the so-called “orphan issues,” namely issues that were mandated in the Paris outcome but lacked a “home” on the subsidiary bodies’ agendas. These included, as per an APA Co-Chairs’ informal note, common timeframes for NDCs, adjustment of existing NDCs, the response measures forum, recognizing developing countries’ adaptation efforts, guidance related to finance, setting a new collective goal on finance, developed countries’ biennial finance communications, and education, training and awareness, among others.</p>
<p>Discussed during the first week under an APA sub-item on preparing for the convening of CMA 1, parties could not agree on which “orphan” issues should be addressed (including whether only issues mandated for CMA 1 should be included), which bodies should carry out related work, and, finally, how to mandate further work. The “orphans” became one of the final issues to be agreed before parties could adopt the COP and CMA decisions on the Paris Agreement in Marrakech, and was finally resolved by mandating the APA to continue its consideration of “possible additional matters relating to the implementation of the Paris Agreement and convening of CMA 1.” This ambiguous wording, some suggested, may come back to haunt countries at the next APA session.</p>
<p><strong><em>MOVING FURTHER, FASTER, TOGETHER</em></strong></p>
<p>A lesson from the past on the minds of many at COP 22 is that the technical is often political. This year, expectations regarding progress in Marrakech were, perhaps unfairly, heightened by the Paris Agreement’s rapid entry into force and raised further by the perceived need to send strong signals of unity and determination, given the uncertainty caused by the US election results. Rising to this call, delegates gave themselves only two years to complete work on the rulebook, a task that for the Kyoto Protocol required three years to realize and necessitated a resumed COP 6<em>bis </em>in 2001, given failure to reach consensus on a number of key political issues by the original deadline of 2000.</p>
<p>Another lesson learned is that at times of uncertainty the world looks for leadership. At COP 7, amid the vacuum left by the US departure from the Kyoto Protocol, parties bent over backwards to facilitate ratifications by Canada, Japan and the Russian Federation, and lauded EU leadership. With another possible leadership vacuum emerging, many looked for signs of new leaders stepping forward. Some looked to the big players, namely China and the EU, to carry on the torch of climate action. Yet, as the COP concluded, others nominated themselves, including the Climate Vulnerable Forum’s 48 members who pledged to be 100% renewable by 2050. One observer suggested this was a sign of “leadership shifting to countries small in size and big in ambition.” Moving ahead, delegates will have to go, as expressed by Global Climate Champion Hakima El Haité, “further, faster, together” in order to complete their dual tasks of finalizing the rulebook while delivering on pre-2020 climate action.</p>

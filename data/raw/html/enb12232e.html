THE UNFCCC WORKSHOP ON THE PREPARATION OF NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS FROM NON-ANNEX
I PARTIES: </font></b></p>
<p class="HEADLINE2" align="center"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">26-30 APRIL
2004</font></b></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) workshop on the preparation of
national communications from non-Annex I Parties was held from 26-30 April 2004,
in Manila, the Philippines. The workshop brought together 88 participants
representing 50 countries and 13 organizations, including non-governmental and
intergovernmental organizations, and UN organizations, including UNDP and UNEP.
The event was organized by the UNFCCC Secretariat and the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) of the Philippines, in collaboration
with UNDP Philippines and the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN).
Funding for the workshop was provided by the Governments of Spain, Switzerland,
the US and APN.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The workshop
provided an opportunity to inform non-Annex I Parties on the application of the
revised Guidelines for the preparation of non-Annex I national communications
adopted at COP-8 in 2002, and the Guidelines user manual developed by the UNFCCC
Secretariat. It also provided an opportunity to exchange information on
financial and technical support, including information on the procedures for
accessing financial resources and support for preparing national communications
from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and its implementing agencies.
Finally, the workshop aimed to identify other specific needs and concerns
relating to the preparation of national communications, and ways to overcome
these.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Throughout the
week, workshop participants attended 11 plenary sessions on relevant issues,
including: national circumstances; national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories;
measures to facilitate adequate adaptation to climate change; measures to
mitigate climate change; other information relevant to the UNFCCC; constraints
and gaps, and related financial, technical and capacity needs; the development
of project proposals for funding second national communications; relevant
regional and multi-country projects and programmes; multilateral and regional
support programmes; and bilateral support programmes.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The workshop
discussions resulted in agreement on a series of recommendations on non-Annex I
national communications that will be submitted as part of the report of the
workshop for consideration at the twentieth sessions of the UNFCCC's Subsidiary
Bodies (SB-20), scheduled for June 2004 in Bonn, Germany.  The workshop was
immediately followed by a meeting of the Consultative Group of Experts on
non-Annex I national communications (CGE), who were expected to discuss the
training programmes, support and technical assistance required by non-Annex I
Parties in preparing their second national communications, based on outcomes at
the workshop.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This report
summarizes the discussions at the workshop, organized according to the workshop
agenda.</font></p>
<p class="HEADLINE25" align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>A BRIEF
HISTORY OF NON-ANNEX I REPORTING UNDER THE UNFCCC</b> </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">UNFCCC:</font></b><font size="2">
The international political response to climate change took shape with the
adoption of the UNFCCC, which entered into force in 1994. The UNFCCC sets out a
framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric GHG concentrations at a
level that would prevent human-induced actions from leading to "dangerous
interference" with the climate system. Under the UNFCCC, all Parties are
required to provide regular reports on the steps they are taking to implement
the UNFCCC.</font></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">NON-ANNEX
I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS: </font></b><font size="2">Consistent with the
principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities," the content and
timetable for submitting these reports – or "national communications" – varies
depending on whether the country is an "Annex I" (industrialized countries and
most economies in transition) or "non-Annex I" (mostly developing countries)
Party. Due to their circumstances, the UNFCCC granted non-Annex I Parties a more
flexible timetable for preparing and submitting their national communications.
Most non-Annex I Parties must submit their first national communications within
three years of becoming Parties to the UNFCCC. Although the least developed
countries (LDCs) are entitled to make their initial communications "at their
discretion." Non-Annex I Parties are eligible for financial and technical
assistance from the GEF for preparing these national communications. In
addition, other donors and agencies have also provided assistance.</font></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Building on the
provisions in the UNFCCC, further work on non-Annex I Parties' national
communications was completed at the second Conference of the Parties (COP-2)
held in Geneva in July 1996. At COP-2, delegates agreed on the substance that
should be contained in national communications, and set out guidelines for such
communications (decision 10/CP.2). </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">THE
CONSULTATIVE GROUP OF EXPERTS: </font></b><font size="2">At COP-5, Parties
decided to initiate a process to review the reporting guidelines agreed at COP-2
and to improve the preparation of non-Annex I national communications (decision
8/CP.5). To facilitate this process, the COP established a Consultative Group of
Experts on national communications from non-Annex I Parties (CGE). The COP
decided that the CGE should be composed of five experts from each of the
developing country regions (Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and
the Caribbean), six experts from Annex I Parties, and three experts from
organizations with relevant experience. At COP-7 in 2001, delegates agreed to
continue the process of reviewing the guidelines in accordance with decision
8/CP.5.</font></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">THE
REVISED GUIDELINES:</font></b><font size="2"> At COP-8, Parties adopted revised
Guidelines for the preparation of non-Annex I national communications (decision
17/CP.8). At COP-9, held in late 2003, Parties identified a need for continued
financial and technical support to enhance national capacities in non-Annex I
Parties to prepare their second, and where appropriate, third national
communications.</font></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To date, 112 out
of 148 non-Annex I Parties have submitted their initial national communications.
Mexico and the Republic of Korea have also submitted their second national
communications. Other Parties are currently undertaking this task, based on the
Guidelines adopted at COP-8, and supported by the CGE.</font></p>
<p class="HEADLINE25" align="center"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">REPORT OF
THE WORKSHOP</font></b></p>
<p class="HEADLINE3" align="justify"><b><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">SESSION ONE:
OPENING ADDRESSES</font></i></b></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On Monday morning,
26 April, Elisea Gozun, Secretary of DENR, the Philippines, opened the meeting.
She thanked the UNFCCC Secretariat, UNDP Philippines, and the APN, as well as
the Governments of Spain, Switzerland, and the US, for co-sponsoring this event.
She stressed the need for urgent and coordinated action on climate change.
</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Deborah Landey,
UNDP Resident Representative for the Philippines, stressed UNDP's commitment,
along with the GEF and UNEP, to support developing countries' implementation of
multilateral agreements. She indicated that the workshop was a timely
opportunity to increase developing country capacity to submit their national
communications, in light of the revised reporting Guidelines. Noting that the
GHG inventory is at the heart of every national communication report, she
stressed the need to support this process.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">Celso Diaz,
Scientific Planning Group Member of the Philippines for APN, outlined the work
of APN, which is an intergovernmental regional network. Explaining that APN is
involved in various capacity-building initiatives, he reported progress on the
Scientific Capacity Building and Enhancement for Sustainable Development in
Developing Countries initiative (CAPaBLE), </font><span lang="EN-GB">
<font size="2">a capacity-building partnership project launched in 2003 that
aims to build and enhance capacity among leading and aspiring scientists in
developing countries, and to disseminate science to decision makers and civil
society.</font></span></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Luis
Gómez-Echeverri, Coordinator of the Implementation Programme and the Subsidiary
Body for Implementation (SBI), UNFCCC Secretariat, expressed satisfaction at the
large number of Parties and organizations represented at the workshop. Observing
that 2004 was the tenth anniversary of the UNFCCC's entry into force, he said
the next decade would involve a strong focus on implementation. He emphasized
the importance of national communications in this regard, and explained that
this workshop would help launch the second round of non-Annex I national
communications.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Martha Perdomo,
Manager of the non-Annex I Implementation Subprogramme, UNFCCC Secretariat, said
Julian Amador, Director of the Environmental Management Bureau of the
Philippines, would chair the meeting, assisted by Jose Villarin of the Manila
Observatory, and Joyceline Goco, Head of the Inter-Agency Committee on Climate
Change of the Philippines. Rapporteurs of the workshop were: Philip Acquah
(Ghana), for the session on GHG inventories; Gwendoline Sissiou (Papua New
Guinea), for the session on adaptation; Jae-Kyu Lim (Republic of Korea), for the
session on climate change mitigation; Julia Martinez Fernandez (Mexico), for the
sessions on other information and on constraints and gaps; and Rawleston Moore
(Barbados), for the sessions on financial and technical support. </font></p>
<p class="HEADLINE3" align="justify"><b><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">SESSION TWO:
NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES</font></i></b></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On Monday,
delegates considered the status of non-Annex I Parties in preparing their
national communications. Introducing the revised UNFCCC reporting Guidelines,
Martha Perdomo, UNFCCC Secretariat, highlighted the importance of effective
national institutional arrangements to ensure continuity in the process of
preparing communications and noted that several countries have established
National Committees on Climate Change to prepare these reports. Perdomo
indicated that 112 (or 71%) of non-Annex I Parties have submitted their first
communications, including over 60% of the LDCs, and said submissions of national
communications from India, China and Brazil are nearing completion. Regarding
second national communications, she said these have been submitted by Mexico and
the Republic of Korea. She noted that Uruguay has almost completed its second
report, and will be the first to submit a communication based on the revised
Guidelines. She said Argentina and Costa Rica have also begun preparing their
second communications. She informed delegates that a synthesis report of the
national communications of 99 non-Annex I countries, presented by the
Secretariat at COP-9, had helped identify methodological, institutional and
financial problems encountered in preparing communications. Some of these
problems had been addressed in the revised UNFCCC Guidelines, which also take
into consideration earlier COP decisions. She noted that the next synthesis
document will be prepared in 2005.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Graham Sem, UNFCCC
Secretariat, provided an overview of how to report on national circumstances in
non-Annex I national communications. He drew attention to the key elements
required in preparing the reports, including information on: development
priorities, objectives and circumstances; formats, summaries, maps, tables and
charts; institutional arrangements; and reference materials and sources of these
materials. He highlighted the lack of clarity on institutional responsibilities
as an inhibiting factor in finalizing national communications, particularly
where a large number of stakeholders are involved. </font></p>
<p class="HEADLINE3" align="justify"><i><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SESSION
THREE: NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORIES</font></b></i></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On Monday,
participants discussed national GHG inventories, which they stressed constitute
a major part of national communications. Presentations were delivered on a
number of relevant topics, including: reporting of national GHG inventories; the
revised 1996 Reporting Guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC), and the IPCC inventory software; IPCC good practice guidance and
uncertainty management in national GHG inventories; the emission factor database
(EFDB); IPCC good practice guidance for land use, land-use change, and forestry
(LULUCF); and two case studies of national experiences in elaborating GHG
inventories. Participants also engaged in a general discussion on inventories.
</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dominique Revet,
UNFCCC Secretariat, discussed technical developments in GHG inventory reporting.
He highlighted various new developments, including the adoption of the Revised
1996 IPCC Reporting Guidelines and UNFCCC Guidelines for the preparation of
national communications from non-Annex I Parties (decision 17/CP.8), and
completion of a UNFCCC manual for the Guidelines on preparing non-Annex I
communications. He also drew attention to the development by the UNFCCC
Secretariat of a modified version of the IPCC GHG inventory software to be
released in late 2004, and acceptance by the IPCC in 2003 of the good practice
guidance for LULUCF, and the IPCC EFDB. Revet provided a detailed account of the
revised Guidelines for preparing non-Annex I national communications from COP-8,
which included information on methodologies and reporting procedures. </font>
</p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Kiyoto Tanabe,
IPCC, briefed participants on the Revised 1996 IPCC Reporting Guidelines and
accompanying inventory software. He outlined the work of the IPCC's National
Greenhouse Gas Inventory Programme, including the various reports and tools it
has prepared since 1995 to assist in the preparation of national GHG
inventories. He informed delegates that the IPCC has started work on revising
the 1996 Guidelines by 2006.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Leandro Buendia,
IPCC, spoke about good practice guidance and uncertainty management in national
GHG inventories, which had been addressed in an IPCC report published in 2000.
He outlined the report's guidance on how to reduce uncertainties and increase
accuracy, transparency, comparability, and consistency over time. He detailed
various methodological issues, including how to identify key sources of
emissions – known as "key source categories." He explained that countries can
take quantitative or qualitative approaches to identifying key source
categories.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tanabe then
presented the EFDB, a database of "emission factors," which are indicative
emissions that take into account local conditions. He indicated that the aim of
the EFDB is to save time and resources in countries that lack emission factors
for certain sectors by providing easy access to such data from other countries
with similar conditions. Tanabe invited contributions to the database, which
will be evaluated by an EFDB editorial board prior to their use. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Leandro Buendia
then briefed participants on the IPCC's good practice guidance for LULUCF,
accepted by the IPCC prior to COP-9, which he said aims to provide guidance on
how to undertake inventories in the forestry, agriculture and land use sectors.
Buendia explained that past IPCC guidance had not covered LULUCF activities, as
they were being discussed in the context of the IPCC Special Report on LULUCF.
He indicated that the good practice guidance aims to provide guidance on the
choice of methods available to estimate LULUCF inventories within the context of
the IPCC guidelines. It also provides data and information on sources and sinks,
and estimated levels of carbon dioxide emissions for LULUCF activities.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Following the IPCC
presentations, participants were briefed on two case studies relating to GHG
inventories. Jose Villarin, Manila Observatory, outlined the experience of the
Philippines in addressing issues of resource assessment for its first national
communication. In particular, he reported on various technical, human,
institutional and financial gaps and obstacles hindering this work. Identifying
key technical issues, he noted challenges relating to information management,
networking and communication, training, archiving and research. Regarding gaps
in human capacity, he highlighted the need to secure effective management and
leadership, and to develop a critical mass of sector-specific expertise. On
institutional issues, he stressed the value of a legal framework to facilitate
information sharing among government agencies, while on financial issues, he
highlighted questions of funding allocation, including the cost-effectiveness of
outsourcing.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Samuel Adejuwon,
Federal Ministry of the Environment of Nigeria, briefed participants on his
country's experience in preparing the GHG inventory for its first national
communication, submitted in November 2003. Focusing on the resources available
for this work, he drew attention to the various sources of data, information,
and financial and technical support. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Participants then
discussed ways to disseminate the EFDB, as well as criteria to establish
consistency between methodologies developed at the national level and those
recommended by the IPCC. Speaking for the IPCC, Kiyoto Tanabe responded that,
while national methodologies are encouraged, it is difficult to define general
criteria to judge their consistency with IPCC methodologies. The World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) suggested that developing countries should
highlight their own contributions to the preparation of national communications,
so as to encourage donors. Graham Sem, UNFCCC Secretariat, informed participants
that the revised Guidelines include a section on contributions made by non-Annex
I countries in "cash and kind," towards the preparation of their national
communications. </font></p>
<p class="HEADLINE3" align="justify"><i><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SESSION FOUR:
ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE</font></b></i></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Throughout the day
on Tuesday, 27 April, participants considered reporting on measures to
facilitate adequate adaptation to climate change. In the morning, presentations
addressed adaptation measures, methodologies, policy frameworks, guidelines,
tools, and programmes of action<b>.</b> In the afternoon, participants heard
presentations and participated in a panel discussion on the UNDP Adaptation
Policy Framework (APF). </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Graham Sem, UNFCCC
Secretariat, presented on information to be provided on vulnerability and
adaptation (V&amp;A) in national communications, as defined in the revised UNFCCC
Guidelines on non-Annex I national communications. This should include
information on, <i>inter alia,</i> the adverse affects of climate change,
critically vulnerable areas, the adaptation measures required, and national and
regional programmes to facilitate adaptation. Sem pointed out that, in addition
to internationally-agreed guidelines such as the IPCC technical guidelines for
assessing climate change impacts and adaptation, Parties are free to use
methodologies developed nationally or regionally, provided they are consistent,
transparent, and well documented. He observed that the UNFCCC Guidelines call
for an evaluation of identified adaptation strategies and measures. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Isabelle Niang
Diop, University of Dakar, Senegal, spoke about the methodologies and frameworks
developed to undertake V&amp;A assessments. She outlined the "first generation" of
methodologies and frameworks, including the 1994 IPCC Technical Guidelines, as
well as subsequent methodologies derived from these. She also drew attention to
an alternative approach, known as the "vulnerability-resilience approach" – that
was applied by some small island developing States, and reflected a greater
focus on traditional knowledge. Niang Diop then elaborated on the "second
generation" of methodologies developed in recent years, including the UNDP APF,
the LDC national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs), and the UK Climate
Impacts Programme. She explained that these newer methodologies were less
prescriptive, placed adaptation within a broader development context, included a
greater focus on stakeholder participation, and took into account current
conditions, as well as future vulnerability. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Xianfu Lu, Tyndall
Centre for Climate Change Research, UK, discussed the modeling of climate change
impacts and response measures. She described V&amp;A impact assessment as one
component of an integrated climate change framework. She explained that
state-of-the art modeling involves process-based biophysical impact methods,
transient climate change and sea-level rise scenarios, refined socioeconomic
baselines, and high resolution data. However, she stressed that gaps remain in
modeling approaches, including a mismatch between global and local impact
assessment models, inadequate data (including climate data), insufficient
methods and tools to model extremes events, and abstract or overly-complex
models. She noted that, while climate models have previously focused on
biophysical processes, the integration of macroeconomic impacts and other human
dimensions of global change are also needed. She suggested that to effect
changes in the "real world," V&amp;A assessments should address the needs of a
broader range of stakeholder groups. This would require model developers to, <i>
inter alia</i>: address short- or medium-term variability; make models
accessible to a wider range of stakeholders; and integrate climate change
modeling impacts into planning across levels of decision-making. She concluded
that modeling was only one approach to assess impacts and response measures to
climate change.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Olga Pilifosova,
UNFCCC Secretariat, described the work of the Secretariat in collecting and
disseminating information on methods and tools to assess climate impacts and V&amp;A
measures in a Compendium that was first developed in 1999, and updated in 2003.
She explained that, with the Compendium, the Secretariat had sought to enhance
dissemination of such methods, encourage application of best available methods,
and improve the quality of these methodologies. She noted that the Compendium
was not prescriptive, but provided users with the information needed to make
their own choices. She also presented the results of an expert meeting held in
Manila on 25-26 April 2004, where users proposed further additions and
improvements to the compendium.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Madeleine Diouf,
Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, Senegal, briefed participants on
NAPAs, focusing on the immediate needs and concerns of LDCs, including technical
requirements, and resource mobilization. She outlined the NAPA process, which
she said was designed to respond to the urgent needs of LDCs. She explained that
preparing a NAPA takes 12-18 months, costs US$200,000, and requires external
financial resources. Diouf identified an increase in vector- and water-borne
diseases, flooding, biodiversity loss, and desertification as key consequences
of climate change in LDCs. She stressed that NAPAs help identify and prioritize
options and tools to address such problems. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the ensuing
discussion participants drew attention to the PRECIS regional impact assessment
model developed by the UK's Hadley Centre and asked about its status. UNDP
informed participants that the model and an accompanying workbook would be made
available at SB-20.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Replying to a
question from Burkina Faso about funding assistance for preparing NAPAs,
Madeleine Diouf stated that a number of countries working through UNEP had
already received financing. UNDP acknowledged that there had been a delay in
disbursing funds to countries working through UNDP due to "administrative
problems." Martha Perdomo, UNFCCC Secretariat, indicated that many of the
numerous resources available on national communications would be compiled into a
CD-ROM that would be distributed at the end of this workshop. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On Tuesday
afternoon, the session on adaptation resumed with a presentation from William
Dougherty, Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI)-Boston, who provided an
overview of the UNDP APF and its outputs. He explained that the APF aims to
build "resilience" and help communities cope with climate change. He stated that
the APF places adaptation within a development context by building on existing
adaptation activities, recognizing that adaptation is required at different
levels – in particular at the local level, and acknowledging that adaptation is
a continuous process. Operationally, he explained that the APF looks at
coordination and implementation and aims to be flexible. It can be tailored to
suit national priorities and the key vulnerable systems identified in each
country, and takes a stakeholder-driven approach. Dougherty reported that APF
outputs include a resource "package," which contains a guidebook to facilitate
the APF planning process, as well as nine technical papers, a five-module
training package and an illustrative set of case studies. He indicated that the
APF's first phase, which ended in early 2004, had completed the framework and
was aiming to put in place an APF Training Strategy. Phase two will follow
shortly with a new series of technical papers.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Presenting an
overview of the APF Training Strategy, Dougherty told participants that it
utilizes a technique of Continuous Professional Development (CPD), and goes
beyond conventional five-day training workshops. CPD is intended for longer
durations, and customized material will be provided for different professional
groups. There will also be an emphasis on local ownership of outcomes, as well
as stronger feedback and evaluation mechanisms. Dougherty added that CPD will
focus on three major areas – food security, water and health – along with the
crosscutting issue of sustainable livelihoods. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Luis Paz Castro,
Institute of Meteorology, Cuba, presented his perspective on the APF in the
context of second national communications, focusing on initiatives occurring in
Central America and the Caribbean. Noting that this is the pilot region for
elaborating and applying the APF, he described Cuba's involvement in an APF
pilot project on Capacity Building for Stage II Adaptation to Climate Change in
Central America, Mexico and Cuba (Stage II activities are measures which may be
taken to prepare for adaptation, including further capacity building). The
project aims to strengthen the adaptive capacity of the human system to reduce
vulnerability to climate change. He then outlined the synergies and coordination
achieved between this project and others in the region. Reflecting on Cuba's
experiences with the pilot project, he drew several conclusions, including that
adaptation is a process that should begin with a reduction of vulnerability to
current climate variability. He also stressed the need for cooperation,
emphasizing that a single country does not possess the capacity and experience
needed to develop all the necessary policies and actions to adapt to climate
variability and climate change.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">PANEL
DISCUSSION:</font></b><font size="2"> Following the presentations, a panel of
experts from the APF pilot region engaged in discussion with participants on
training needs and national experiences in implementing the APF. The panel
included Luis Paz Castro, William Dougherty, and Eduardo Reyes (Panama). Reyes
shared his experiences of the regional pilot project regarding vulnerability
indicators in watersheds. He identified several drawbacks to the APF, including
the lack of clear social vulnerability indicators, insufficient guidance on the
elaboration of project outputs, and a limited conceptual framework of
vulnerability. On lessons learned he emphasized that future APF projects will
require adequate funds to implement stakeholder consultation. </font></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Samoa asked
panelists about the expected project outputs and how the stakeholder process was
implemented. Reyes replied that outputs would include vulnerability maps, which
might help to determine future vulnerability. On stakeholder involvement, he
noted that costs were too high to undertake in-depth consultation. Burkina Faso
asked if the APF could be implemented at any stage in the preparation of
national communications. Paz Castro replied that it could be, given the APF's
flexibility. Dougherty said UNDP/GEF intended to hold workshops in the pilot
project region and develop a list of common "pressing" vulnerabilities in the
region. They will also design a set of group exercises directly related to needs
assessment. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Nigeria raised the
issue of replicating the pilot project in Africa and other regions. On the
question of funding for adaptation, UNDP noted that GEF is working on
operationalizing an adaptation funding window that will have US$50 million in
the next budget cycle (2005-2007). Coupled with the UNFCCC Special Climate
Change Fund that is expected to become operational in 2004, these represent the
first steps of a process designed to make funding available for adaptation. On a
question from the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) about the
status of the APF, Dougherty described it as a coherent, accessible and credible
framework for adaptation needs. UNDP supported the APF as one useful approach
that could be applied in various circumstances, while noting that it might not
be applicable to every situation. </font></p>

MEASURES TO MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE</font></b></i></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On Wednesday
morning, 28 April, delegates considered reporting on measures to mitigate
climate change, with presentations covering issues such as: mitigation
programmes; methodologies, technical resources and guidelines; and data,
information, financial and technical services, and support. The session
concluded with a general discussion.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dominique Revet,
UNFCCC Secretariat, opened the session with a presentation reporting on national
mitigation programmes in the national communications. Noting that the original
COP-2 decision on non-Annex I national communications had contained very little
guidance on this issue, he explained that the COP-8 Guidelines had set out
further guidance. Revet then elaborated on the four paragraphs on mitigation
reporting contained in the Guidelines (paragraphs 37-40). These paragraphs
contain information and guidance describing the benefits of mitigation measures,
the methodological approaches and models available for mitigation assessments,
the technical resources involved in such assessments, and the value of sector-
and project-specific information.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Revet then
outlined the methodologies, technical resources and guidelines available for
reporting on mitigation programmes, pointing out that the first step involves
choosing from a range of "bottom-up" and "top-down" methodologies available for
mitigation analysis. He described the available options and processes for
evaluating national social and economic development frameworks for climate
change mitigation, baseline scenario projections, mitigation scenario
projections, macroeconomic scenarios and implementation issues. In the
discussion that followed, Revet highlighted the value of revisiting the
mitigation analysis carried out in first national communications, in order to
update their information and analysis. The Philippines noted the importance of
financial and technical capacity development in conducting the analysis. </font>
</p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-GB">
<font size="2">Vute Wangwacharakul, Department of Agricultural and Resource
Economics, Kasetsart University, Thailand, briefed participants on the process
involved in preparing Thailand's first national communication. Focusing on the
reporting on mitigation activities, he began by identifying the strengths and
weaknesses in the process of preparing the first communication, noting that on
the financial and technical aspects, Thailand had benefited from numerous
multilateral and bilateral programmes, including UNDP/GEF country programmes, as
well as relevant national sectoral development plans and economic analyses.
However, he also observed that comprehensive data on specific sectors was
largely absent and that accessing information sources had been problematic.
Wangwacharakul emphasized the advantages of subcontracting experts from local
universities and non-governmental organizations, while engaging international
experts as and when needed. He reported that the preparation of Thailand's
second national communication required additional stocktaking and the inclusion
of the agriculture and livestock sectors. Wangwacharakul concluded that the
preparation of non-Annex I communications was a "capacity-building process" that
was largely dependent on the availability of financial resources and the
effective use of existing national and regional capacities. He added that the
process also hinged on adequate opportunities to combine capacity between
sectoral and climate change experts, the potential to improve </font></span>
<font size="2">modeling</font><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2"> capacity, and
the availability of support from multilateral agencies and bilateral donors.</font></span></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Julia Martínez
Fernández, Ministry for the Environment, Mexico, briefed participants on her
country's mitigation policies and activities. Noting that Mexico's second
national communication includes various mitigation policies, she reported on
mitigation activities in key sectors, including projects to develop combined
cycle power plants, industrial cogeneration, renewable energy, efficient
lighting in homes, efficient air conditioning equipment, reforestation projects,
and energy efficiency at PEMEX, the government-owned oil company. Noting the
environmental, economic and health benefits of mitigation projects, she observed
that Mexico has now decoupled emissions growth from economic growth.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The morning
session ended with a general discussion. Responding to a question from Iran
about the drop in energy intensity in Mexico in the late 1990s, Martínez said
this was because of a devaluation of the Peso in 1995. Barbados raised concerns
that the revised UNFCCC Guidelines increased the information requirements,
expertise and resources needed to prepare the second national communication, as
compared to the first communication. Wangwacharakul agreed that the quality of
technical information in the second national communication would depend on the
resources available. Responding to a question on the length of the national
communications, Revet and Philip Weech, UNFCCC Secretariat, said this would be
decided by national governments, but added that the Secretariat would need some
background information to compile the synthesis report. </font></p>
<p class="HEADLINE3" align="justify"><i><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SESSION SIX:
OTHER INFORMATION</font></b></i></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On Wednesday
afternoon, participants heard presentations on other information considered
relevant to the UNFCCC in the context of non-Annex I national communications.
These covered several specific areas, including: research and systematic
observation; the development and transfer of technologies; education, training
and public awareness, and capacity building; and information and networking.
Participants also engaged in a general discussion. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Philip Weech,
UNFCCC Secretariat, presented an overview of other information relevant to the
UNFCCC. He explained that "other information" relates to UNFCCC Article 12.1,
which calls for the inclusion of any other information relevant to the
achievement of the objectives of the UNFCCC in Parties' national communications.
Other information is also prioritized in the revised UNFCCC Guidelines
(paragraph 41). He concluded by emphasizing the need for financial and technical
support in the preparation of national communications, particularly in the area
of capacity building.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Olga Pilifosova,
UNFCCC Secretariat, spoke about research and systematic observation, focusing on
the reporting requirements contained in the UNFCCC Guidelines. On systematic
observation, she informed participants of various UNFCCC decisions aimed at
strengthening the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). She then outlined the
UNFCCC Guidelines' requirements for reporting on GCOS activities. On the issue
of research programmes, she highlighted the relevant part of the UNFCCC
Guidelines, and drew attention to the user manual on research and systematic
observation. Finally, she noted that the eighteenth session of the Subsidiary
Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) had initiated two new
relevant agenda items, on "scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of
impacts of, and vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change," and on
"scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of mitigation." These issues
would be addressed in workshops and side events planned for SBSTA-20.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yolando Velasco,
UNFCCC Secretariat, spoke about reporting on capacity building, technology
transfer, and education, training and public awareness. He pointed out that
these are crosscutting, closely related issues, and that there is the
possibility of duplicating activities when assessing needs under each of them.
He observed that while the scope of countries' capacity-building needs could
easily cover almost everything related to climate change, Parties should try to
identify clear priorities. On technology transfer, Velasco identified five
areas: technology needs assessment, information related to technology, enabling
environments, capacity building, and mechanisms for technology transfer. He said
around 80 Parties were involved in technology needs assessments. He drew
attention to the New Delhi Work Programme on UNFCCC Article 6 (education,
training, and public awareness) that was now being implemented, and indicated
that regional workshops were being conducted to identify Parties' specific
needs. He concluded by highlighting the need for country-driven stakeholder
involvement, and for developing synergies and interlinkages. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jack Fitzgerald,
US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), briefed participants on the UNFCCC
Guidelines' reporting requirements on information and networking. According to
the Guidelines (paragraph 48), "non-Annex I Parties are encouraged to provide
information on their efforts to promote information sharing among and within
counties and regions." However, Fitzgerald explained that non-Annex I Parties
had faced problems accessing information and identifying networks in the
preparation of their national communications, due in part to the absence of
national scientific and technical expertise, and to difficulties in accessing
international networks. On information sharing, he suggested that Parties should
explore creative forms of communication, and illustrated an example of the US
Climate Technology Cooperation and Gateway website, which provides links to
computer models, such as LEAP – a software tool for integrated energy,
environment and GHG mitigation analysis. Fitzgerald concluded by highlighting
that Parties faced a dilemma of global "information overload," while they were
also challenged with accessing, updating and manipulating information at the
national level.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the subsequent
discussion, participants raised issues of technology needs assessments, capacity
building, and public awareness. Participants discussed at length on technology
needs assessments, including how these relate to second national communications.
Martha Perdomo, UNFCCC Secretariat, encouraged Parties to submit their
technology needs assessments officially to the Secretariat. Thailand informed
participants of a proposal to include information on technology needs
assessments on the TT:Clear website, which is an information clearing house on
technology transfer issues. He also observed that the level of funding provided
for these assessments had placed limits on how much work was possible. </font>
</p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Peru suggested
that not enough progress had been made on public awareness, which she felt would
be critical over the next few years. Kenya agreed, noting that her country's

technical and capacity needs relevant to the preparation of second national
communications. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Philip Weech,
UNFCCC Secretariat, observed that, as part of their national communications,
non-Annex I Parties are required to provide a list of projects that they are
proposing for financing. He noted that, although such lists were included in the
first national communications by many non-Annex I Parties, the proposals had not
yet been considered for funding. He said the Secretariat is working on a paper
for consideration at COP-10, to address the issue of project funding under
non-Annex I national communications. Weech then informed participants on the
process of submitting national communications, pointing out that they should be
in one of the UN languages, and should include an executive summary. Additional
supporting information can be added as technical annexes. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A general

EIGHT: DEVELOPMENT OF PROPOSALS FOR PREPARING SECOND NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS</font></i></b></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On Thursday
morning, 29 April, participants were briefed on the development of proposals for
preparing second national communications. The briefings were given by officials
from UNDP and UNEP, the two GEF implementing agencies involved in supporting the
process of preparing national communications. Their presentations covered a
variety of relevant issues, including lessons learned during the process of
preparing first national communications, and the approach to be taken while
preparing or submitting proposals for second national communications. There was
also a general discussion on the issue.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ravi Sharma, UNEP,
opened the session, looking at lessons learned during the first national
communications process. He highlighted the need for appropriate technical
support and easy access to methodologies and tools in preparing GHG inventories,
as well as the benefits of regional workshops. He also stressed the need to
improve project management and coordination at the national level, and the
importance of transparency, stakeholder involvement and awareness-raising.
Effective data management and sustaining capacity in terms of the expertise
developed during the first national communications process were also seen as
critical for preparing second communications. Identifying lessons learned for
the implementing agencies, Sharma highlighted proposals to improve monitoring
and evaluation, take advantage of best practices and make use of them in a
systematic way, and exploit linkages and synergies with other relevant projects.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rebecca Carman,
UNDP, outlined the approach that will be taken to support non-Annex I Parties in
preparing their second national communications. She explained that it would
involve a joint GEF/UNDP/UNEP programme with a budget of US$60.2 million. The
programme would run from 2004-09, and was expected to involve 130 non-Annex I
Parties. The new approach was intended to help streamline and expedite the
process, and to improve monitoring, evaluation, and the support services
available to countries. Carman explained that this approach would involve three
components: a self-assessment process; preparation of the national communication
itself; and a National Communications Support Programme (NCSP). Countries will
be able to access US$15,000 for the self-assessment, and up to US$405,000 for
the national communication. She also noted that project approval had been
decentralized from the GEF Secretariat to UNDP and UNEP, which should expedite
the release of funds.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yamil Bonduki,
UNDP, summarized the key features of the revised GEF Operational Procedures for
funding the preparation of second national communications. He also described
UNDP procedures for requesting and approving funding for preparing
communications, and reported on UNDP's experience in reviewing funding
proposals. He explained that the GEF Operational Procedures had been revised to:
facilitate broader stakeholder participation; build on previous work, activities
and knowledge; capture best practices; and develop linkages with other relevant
projects. He informed delegates that under the new expedited route for accessing
GEF funds to prepare national communications, the processing time for proposals
was expected to be no more than 15 days. He noted that UNDP had already received
approximately 22 proposals, most of which followed the template provided by
UNDP, with only minor changes needed. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the discussion
that followed, Bonduki informed participants that UNDP was in the process of
finalizing a format for proposals, and would work closely with a few countries
to develop model proposals. Answering a question from Nigeria on whether the
US$405,000 was the minimum or maximum amount countries could apply for, Bonduki
said it was the maximum using the expedited process, but countries could choose
to apply for a full-sized GEF project instead, in which case the amount could be
higher. However, the procedures would be more complicated, and the process would
take more time. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bonduki then
briefed participants on the development of funding proposals for national
communications. He said development of proposals should involve a stocktaking
exercise to identify gaps and uncertainties encountered in the first national
communications, such as constraints encountered in V&amp;A assessments. He also
recommended that proposals should take into account existing national priorities
and ongoing activities such as NAPAs, and should contain clear and achievable
targets. He advised that proposals should not overestimate the national capacity
available for the preparation of second national communications. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Participants then
engaged in a question-and-answer session with UNDP and UNEP officials on their
presentations. Barbados reiterated the choice that countries face between using
the expedited process for funding their second national communications, or using
the regular GEF project cycle. He pointed out that countries that take the
US$15,000 for the self-assessment must use the expedited process. Burkina Faso
expressed concerns that the US$405,000 allocated for second communications using
the expedited process should be a flexible rather than a fixed amount, and
Nigeria questioned whether this level of funding would be adequate for every
country. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Carman then
briefed participants on the GEF/UNDP/UNEP NCSP, one of the components of the
strategy to support second national communications, with a budget of US$5.5
million. She said UNDP is committed to raising US$1.5 million in co-financing
for the programme. NCSP will provide country-driven technical assistance to all
non-Annex I Parties when preparing their national communications by, <i>inter
alia</i>, sharing knowledge and promoting capacity building through the exchange
of experiences, preparing and disseminating technical materials, and
facilitating communication.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ravi Sharma added
some insights into UNEP's role, observing that NCSP would seek to be more
interactive than it had been in the past. He listed UNEP activities relevant to
NCSP, including the LDC Technical Support Programme, the Coastal Zone Management
support for African islands, and the Global Network on Energy for Sustainable
Development.</font></p>

<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-GB">
<font size="2">Luis Santos, Uruguay's Ministry of Housing, Territorial
Regulation and Environment, briefed participants on the preparation of Uruguay's
second national communication. He explained that the process had engaged
governmental, non-governmental, academic and business stakeholders over a period
of 18 months. Significant institutional challenges had been overcome and
stakeholders had supported the establishment of a new national institution
called PRONAVEN, a public-private entity that aims to encourage co-management
activities. Santos provided details on the contents of Uruguay's national
communication, </font></span><font size="2">which also presents the national GHG
inventory for 2000</font><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">. Mitigation measures
outlined in the national communication are aimed at optimizing the country's
transport sector, as well as improving the agriculture, forestry, waste and
energy sectors. On adaptation measures, he drew attention to national efforts to
protect biodiversity, noting the country's new national legislation on protected
areas. Santos stated that Uruguay had focused on institutional strengthening and
developing a programme for climate change information dissemination, public
awareness and education. He concluded by underscoring the importance of
participation across multiple sectors and levels of decision-making when
preparing national communications. </font></span></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the ensuing
discussion, Sudan enquired about the stakeholders involved in preparing
Uruguay's national communications, and how national institutional capacity had
been assessed. Santos responded that 100 stakeholders from government, civil
society, academic, and private institutions has been involved in the process. He
rated the institutional performance as high. Responding to a question from Iran
on the extent to which Uruguay's national communication reflected national
development plans, Santos explained that its communication included some
national plans, such as the introduction of bio-diesel, but would benefit from
additional links. In response to a question on how Uruguay had addressed gaps in
its first national communication, Santos said it had been necessary to secure
further sectoral involvement in preparing the second communication.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Katarina
Mareckova, UNDP, provided information on a regional project for Capacity
Building for Improving the Quality of Greenhouse Gas Inventories in Eastern
Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, initiated in June 2003. She
said the main objective of the three-year project was to improve documentation
and transparency in GHG inventories. Activities undertaken so far had included:
the identification of key emissions sources in the region; the development of a
regional website, a database of regional experts, and a regional discussion
forum; the organization of several workshops; and preparation and dissemination
of training material. The main benefits of the project include the availability
of comparable data from countries in the region, reduced costs for preparing GHG
inventories, exchange of information, and replicability. Mareckova noted that a
key aim was to encourage the development of national "manuals of procedures" on
creating GHG inventories. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the discussion
that followed, Ghana commented that some countries had such manuals of
procedures, based on the IPCC good practice guidelines, and find them helpful.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ravi Sharma, UNEP,
presented an overview of a project to Assess the Impacts of, and Adaptation to,
Climate Change (AIACC). He explained that the project covers multiple regions
and sectors, involving 24 regional studies and 46 developing countries. It is
funded by the GEF, with UNEP acting as the implementing agency. He indicated
that the project aims to build scientific and technical capacity and support the
development of national communications. It promotes regional V&amp;A assessments and
is also a capacity-building exercise involving stakeholders and national
communications teams. Responding to a question from Senegal about project
follow-up and future financing, Sharma reported that these matters were still
under discussion. On a question from Thailand regarding methodologies, Sharma
explained that AIACC does not promote any particular methodology.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Emilio Sempris,
Water Center for the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean
(CATHALAC), presented on national, regional and multi-country projects related
to climate change. He explained that CATHALAC is dedicated to enhancing
scientific understanding of water management, and described the three-year
project for Capacity Building for Stage II Adaptation to Climate Change in
Central America, Mexico and Cuba. He also described the Mesoamerican Monitoring
and Visualization System, as well as another CATHALAC project to strengthen the
capacity of Central American countries to prevent and manage disasters and to
deal with climate change.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Andrea Volentras,
SPREP, outlined SPREP's activities in assisting Pacific island countries with
their national communications. Outlining lessons learned from the first national
communications process, he noted the need for realistic goals that take into
account the timeframe and available resources. He also stressed the need to
sustain capacity and expertise over the long-term, and to mainstream climate
change within the wider policy arena. Regarding SPREP's plans to assist the
preparation of second national communications, he highlighted that SPREP's 70
staff members had significant expertise on climate issue. He explained that
SPREP can assist with the information stocktaking exercise, and can also support
national stakeholder consultations, the preparation of the funding proposals,
and the second communications exercise itself. He also noted plans to hold
workshops and UNFCCC side events, and a proposal to employ a national
communications adviser, a GHG mitigation officer, and an adaptation officer.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">In the
general discussion that followed, </font><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">
several participants expressed their regrets at the GEF's absence from the
workshop. The UNFCCC Secretariat explained that the GEF's climate team was in a
transitional phase, and had therefore been unable to send a representative to
this workshop. The GEF had sent its apologies that it was unable to attend.
Georgia wondered what incentives had been provided to the private sector in
Uruguay to encourage their involvement in the national communications process.
Santos responded that private sector participation had been voluntary, and that
their interests lay in the economic opportunities provided by measures such as
improvements in energy efficiency or a system of carbon credits. In response to
a query from Senegal on the mandate of the UNFCCC to provide guidance to
Parties, Thailand reminded participants that CGE is mandated to provide Parties

MULTILATERAL AND REGIONAL SUPPORT PROGRAMMES</font></b></i></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On Friday morning,
30 April, delegates were briefed on four support programmes at the multilateral
and regional levels. These included presentations from representatives of the
Asian Development Bank (ADB), WMO, APN, and the Inter-American Institute for
Global Change Research (IAI).</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Edy Brotoisworo,
ADB, opened the session with a presentation on the Climate Change Adaptation
Programme for the Pacific (CLIMAP). Noting that earlier ADB activities to
support the UNFCCC had dealt with climate mitigation, he highlighted the
increasing focus on adaptation that had resulted in the development of CLIMAP.
He explained that CLIMAP seeks to mainstream climate adaptation through risk
reduction. It involves a two-stage approach, starting with a short stocktaking
exercise, followed by a longer process involving pilot activities focused on
Micronesia and the Cook Islands. Responding to a comment from the Philippines
about mainstreaming adaptation within national government plans, Brotoisworo
acknowledged that this was not an easy task, but confirmed that involving
government and other stakeholders was a critical part of the programme.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Buruhani Nyenzi,
WMO, described the WMO's activities related to climate change, including the
World Climate Programme (WCP), GCOS, the World Climate and Climate Research
Programme, and Global Atmospheric Watch. He informed participants that WCP
coordinates most of WMO's climate change-related divisions, including the World
Climate Data Monitoring Programme, the World Climate Applications and Climate
Information and Prediction Services, and the Agricultural Meteorology Programme.
Nyenzi listed the various activities carried out under these programmes, which
he said sought to improve: the capacity of WMO members in climate monitoring;
the systemic global monitoring of atmospheric, oceanic and terrestrial systems;
and climate data "rescue" activities to preserve data at risk of being lost due
to deterioration of the medium used to store it.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">During the
discussion that followed, several participants emphasized the need to involve
meteorological departments in climate change activities. The Philippines noted
that national weather specialists tend to be conservative when it comes to
attributing extreme weather events to global warming, which sometimes sends a
contradictory message.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Samuel Penafiel,
APN, briefed participants on APN's mission, structure and ongoing project
activities. He provided details of APN's four thematic areas: changes in coastal
zones and inland waters; changes in atmospheric composition; climate change and
variability; and changes in terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity. He also
highlighted APN's CAPaBLE project. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Linda Stevenson,
APN, on behalf of Gerhard Breulmann, IAI, spoke about IAI's climate change
programmes and projects. Reflecting on past activities, she drew attention to
work on the Collaborative Research Networks (CRNs), and explained that a second
round of CRNs was now under development. The total budget for these CRNs is
expected to be in the range of US$8–11 million. Looking ahead, she highlighted
IAI's intention to streamline its proposals process, including plans to develop
a fully web-based project submission system. She also noted that IAI is
considering earmarking funds for "young" or "aspiring" scientists. </font></p>

ELEVEN: BILATERAL SUPPORT PROGRAMMES</font></b></i></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On Friday,
delegates were briefed on three bilateral support programmes funded by Canada,
Finland, and the US. The presentations were followed by a general discussion on
the issues raised.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Satender Singh,
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Canada, opened the
session with a description of the Canada Climate Change Development Fund, a
CA$100 million, five-year initiative started in July 2000. He explained that the
Canadian International Development Agency administers the fund, with the broad
goal of promoting activities to combat the causes and effects of climate change
while contributing to sustainable development and poverty reduction. Singh noted
that the fund has four programme areas: emissions reductions, adaptation, carbon
sequestration and core capacity building. He said current activities include 36
main projects, six small project funds created to provide a more flexible and
responsive mechanism, and three contributions to multilateral funds. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mervi Kultamaa,
Second Secretary to Finland's Embassy to the Philippines, reported on a
bilateral support programme for small island developing States in the Caribbean.
Noting that countries in this region are among those suffering the most from
climate change, she highlighted problems with the region's weather observation
systems, which have been deteriorating due to lack of funding, infrastructure
and expertise. Outlining her country's efforts to help strengthen the
meteorological services in the region, Kultamaa reported that Finland had
provided 3.8 million to upgrade the observation network, improve
telecommunications used for transmitting data, and establish a regional
laboratory to provide much-needed instrument calibration and maintenance. The
funding had also been used to rescue historical data and to increase the number
of national meteorological experts. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jack Fitzgerald,
US EPA, on behalf of Toral Patel-Weynand, US Department of State, presented a
list of US bilateral projects in non-Annex I Parties. He elaborated on an
impacts and adaptation project in Mexico, which aims to evaluate adaptation to
the potential impacts of climate change on water resources. The project also
aims to identify, analyze and prioritize adaptation options, and to develop and
apply a process for assessing adaptation needs. Fitzgerald stressed that climate
impacts and adaptation activities should involve local stakeholder processes. He
also drew attention to US engagement in a bilateral initiative on integrated
environmental strategies, which addresses global and local benefits of
climate-related activities involving eight countries worldwide.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the general
discussion that followed, several participants expressed their appreciation at
the support provided by Finland and the US for projects to enhance regional
capacity in tracking climate patterns. Peru noted her gratitude at the role
played by bilateral aid in complementing the resources made available from
multilateral sources, which are sometimes difficult to access. However, she
questioned why only LDCs were provided funds to prepare NAPAs. She said several
other developing countries were experiencing levels of poverty equivalent to
that in LDCs, and faced a dilemma over whether limited available resources
should be spent on development, or on climate change activities.
<a name="RTF4f4c455f4c494e4b31">Mauritius called on</a> the UNFCCC Secretariat
to devise a mechanism to channel bilateral aid in cooperation with other UN
agencies, so as to make it more accessible to small developing countries. Martha
Perdomo, UNFCCC Secretariat, informed participants that the Secretariat has been
mandated to prepare a website listing bilateral sources, and is in the process
of doing so.</font></p>
<p class="HEADLINE3" align="justify"><b><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WORKSHOP</font></i></b></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On Friday
afternoon, Graham Sem, UNFCCC Secretariat, introduced text outlining the
proposed recommendations of the workshop. He noted that this text was based on
issues raised by participants during the workshop, and on the Rapporteurs'
summaries of each session. Participants discussed the substance and accuracy of
these recommendations, making a number of suggestions to improve the text. The
recommendations were then endorsed by participants, on the understanding that
their comments and suggestions would be taken into account when finalizing the
text. The recommendations will form part of the report of the workshop, which
will be transmitted to SBI-20.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">
RECOMMENDATIONS:</font></b><font size="2"> The recommendations include sections
on five topics relating to the preparation of non-Annex I national
communications: national GHG inventories, measures to adapt to climate change;
measures to mitigate the effects of climate change; other information related to
national communications; and financial and technical support.</font></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">National
greenhouse gas inventories: </font></b><font size="2">The section on inventories
recommends that the UNFCCC Secretariat should collaborate with other relevant
organizations to develop a central repository of information, tools and methods
for GHG inventories, funding permitting. These resources would then be
disseminated to non-Annex I Parties. The recommendations include a request that
the Secretariat promote actions such as training and information sharing to help
non-Annex I Parties prepare their GHG inventories.</font></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The
recommendations also highlight the importance of reporting on gaps relating to GHG inventories, as this would help identify capacity-building needs and
relevant financial requirements. In addition, experts and institutions from
non-Annex I Parties are requested to provide information on their national
emission factors to the IPCC EFDB editorial board, and to use the information in
the EFDB whenever appropriate.</font></p>

Gómez-Echeverri, UNFCCC Secretariat, made his closing remarks, thanking the
Government of the Philippines, UNDP Philippines, the US, Spain and Switzerland,
and APN, as well as the GEF and other multilateral and bilateral institutions.
He also expressed his gratitude to the participants, support staff, and the
meeting Chairs and Rapporteurs for their hard work. Noting that the workshop
marked the launch of the second round of national communications, he praised the
number of Parties, estimated at between 50 and 75, that will embark on their
second national communications in 2004. However, he underscored that significant
challenges still remain in ensuring greater capacity, training and general
support to prepare national communications, and for climate change-related
activities at the national level. He highlighted the importance of the work of
the CGE in this regard. </font></p>

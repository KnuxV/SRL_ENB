<font size="2" face="Verdana">SUMMARY OF THE UNFCCC SEMINAR OF
GOVERNMENTAL EXPERTS: <br>
<br>
16-17 MAY 2005</font></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The
Seminar of Governmental Experts was held on 16 and 17 May 2005, at the
Maritim Hotel in Bonn, Germany. The decision to hold a Seminar was taken
by Parties at the Tenth Conference of the Parties (COP-10) to the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in December 2004. The
decision, which followed lengthy discussions at COP-10, sought to
address the question of how to engage on some of the broader issues
facing the climate change process. Foremost among these for some Parties
was the question of a future framework and commitments to combat climate
change in the post-2012 period (the Kyoto Protocol sets emissions
targets for the years 2008-2012). There was also some interest in other
issues, such as how to respond to the increasingly strong evidence of
climate change, address the differences of opinion over Kyoto, and move
forward in dealing both with climate change mitigation and adaptation.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The
issue of a post-2012 framework proved to be particularly sensitive at
COP-10. While the Kyoto Protocol requires Parties to begin considering
the post-2012 period by 2005, many developing countries have objected in
the past to attempts to expand the group of nations that have binding
emissions targets from Annex I Parties into the ranks of the Group of 77
and China (G-77/China). Developing countries argue that industrialized
countries should take the lead, based on the principle of common but
differentiated responsibilities. There was also the question of how to
include non-Parties to Kyoto in talks on subsequent commitments. </font>
</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As a
result of these concerns, the terms of reference set for the Seminar
were kept broad and general, with no specific reference to a post-2012
framework or other controversial matters. Parties at COP-10 agreed that
the Seminar should encourage an "informal exchange of information on:
(a) actions relating to mitigation and adaptation to assist Parties to
continue to develop effective and appropriate responses to climate
change; and (b) policies and measures adopted by their respective
governments that support implementation of their existing commitments."
</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">While
the Seminar had no formal outcome, such as recommendations or a
negotiated text, many participants felt that it had been a very
constructive and open dialogue that had demonstrated a willingness among
Parties to understand others' positions and circumstances, and to begin
the search for innovative ways to accommodate them. However, while being
widely viewed as a step in the right direction, there were few signs
that the differences between Parties had actually narrowed.</font></p>

<font size="2" face="Verdana">REPORT OF THE SEMINAR</font></span></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">UNFCCC
Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter welcomed participants to the
Seminar of Governmental Experts on Monday morning, 16 May. Stating that
this Seminar was the "first of its kind in UNFCCC history," she said
time would tell if it will be remembered as an historic event. She
suggested that, following the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol in
February 2005, this was an opportune moment to consider the
implementation of the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol. She said participants
would be informed about the broad range of approaches Parties have taken
to tackle climate change, reflecting countries' diverse circumstances,
and highlighted that the Seminar was taking place against a backdrop of
rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Delegates then heard two keynote presentations. Jürgen Trittin, German
Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear
Safety, highlighted the need for action on climate change to avoid a
rise of more than 2˚C in global temperatures and the "disastrous and
irreversible damage" that would result. He stated that the Kyoto
Protocol is a first step, but said progress must continue beyond 2012.
He underscored the need for political will to ensure climate protection,
and said this Seminar could provide the basis for a successful start at
the first Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (MOP-1) in
December 2005, with regard to the process of developing a post-2012
framework.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">COP-10
President Ginés González García, Minister of Health and the Environment
of Argentina, said the Seminar was an opportunity to rebuild trust and
confidence, noting the challenge of designing and building the post-2012
structures. He urged industrialized countries to address developing
countries' concerns, including turning pledges into concrete actions,
supporting the various climate funds that exist, and engaging in
technology transfer and supporting adaptation. He indicated that
political will would be critical to building trust and "facilitating
developing countries' active participation in post-Kyoto architecture."</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Following the opening presentations, Co-Chair Masaki Konishi explained
that the Seminar would consist of several sessions, each involving
speeches from several different government experts, followed by an
interactive question-and-answer period. Emphasizing the informal nature
of this meeting, Co-Chair Chow Kok Kee said there would be no Co-Chairs'
conclusions.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Headline3" align="justify"><b><i>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">SESSION ONE</font></i></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The
first session, held on Monday morning, 16 May, involved presentations by
government experts from China, Brazil, Switzerland and the UK, followed
by an interactive question-and-answer session.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">PRESENTATIONS: China: </font></b><font size="2">Feng Gao
drew attention to China's current reliance on coal, stressed the need to
improve energy efficiency, and outlined China's efforts to optimize its
energy structure. He called for international cooperation to introduce
and apply energy saving technologies, corresponding policy incentives
and capacity building, and increased efforts and new mechanisms to
transfer such technologies to developing countries.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">Brazil:</font></b><font size="2"> André Corrêa do Lago
urged cooperation to ensure the success of the UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol
and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) beyond 2012. Outlining
Brazil's experiences with the CDM, he highlighted the CDM's contribution
in achieving the UNFCCC's objective, helping Annex I countries to meet
their commitments, engaging developing countries in mitigation efforts
that would not otherwise be feasible, while raising their living
standards.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">Switzerland:</font></b><font size="2"> Beat Nobs
recognized the need to increase efforts to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions after 2012. He said the international framework should ensure
sustainable development, include all major emitters, reduce greenhouse
gas emissions everywhere, promote the development, use and transfer of
environmentally friendly technology, make use of market forces, and
possibly include timetables and targets for emissions reductions.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">United Kingdom:</font></b><font size="2"> David Warrilow,
on behalf of the European Union (EU), underscored positive feedback and
possible catastrophic impacts as drivers for the EU's proposal to limit
warming to less than 2˚C, emphasizing that the challenge is to meet
growing demand for energy while reducing emissions. He also stressed the
need to address the problem as a matter of urgency.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">DISCUSSION:</font></b><font size="2"> Japan welcomed
China's emphasis on energy savings and efficiency, asked for details on
how China plans to achieve these, and offered technology cooperation. In
response, Feng Gao stressed China's need for energy, noting that, with
hydro and nuclear energy both being criticized, it raised issues about
what options China had. He added that a strong agreement on technology
transfer would be necessary.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The
Cook Islands and Indonesia raised issues about the future role of the
CDM and Joint Implementation (JI), and Luxembourg, for the EU, asked
Brazil about its renewables programme. In response, André Corrêa do Lago
said Brazil has demonstrated that it is possible for a developing
country to have a very high ratio of renewable energy in the matrix.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">China
raised the question of when developed countries could be expected to
show significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and set an
example for developing countries. Romania raised questions about the
role of nuclear power in the second commitment period. He noted the risk
of positive feedback, such as emissions from manufacturing the cement
needed for sea walls and other infrastructure to adapt to sea level
rise. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Headline3" align="justify"><b><i>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">SESSION TWO</font></i></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This
session, held early Monday afternoon, involved presentations from South
Africa, Norway, the European Commission and the US, followed by a
question-and-answer session.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">PRESENTATIONS:</font></b><font size="2"> <b>South Africa:</b>
Alf Wills said the future should involve a strengthened Kyoto Protocol
that includes all countries and recognizes their common but
differentiated responsibilities. He stressed that the science of
adaptation is relatively underdeveloped, highlighted that mitigation and
adaptation in South Africa is an "energy story," and called for a
"roadmap" for negotiations to be developed at COP-11/MOP-1 in Montreal
in late 2005.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">Norway:</font></b><font size="2"> Harald Dovland
underscored that 2012 is only seven years away, a very short time given
the long planning periods needed for many sectors. Commenting on the
shape of a future climate regime, he said it should contain the Kyoto
Protocol's positive elements, such as differentiated commitments,
flexibility and reporting.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">European Commission:</font></b><font size="2"> Artur
Runge-Metzger outlined the EU's progress in achieving the Kyoto targets,
stressing its emphasis on cost-effective policies, a multi-stakeholder
approach, and the use of market-based instruments, regulations and
standards, labeling and voluntary measures. He reported on the EU's
Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which allows linking with Joint
Implementation (JI) and the CDM. He also noted work on the aviation
sector, carbon capture and storage, and adaptation.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">United States:</font></b><font size="2"> Harlan Watson
outlined his country's policies to address climate change, stressing its
commitment to the UNFCCC and the need for sustained efforts by all
nations across generations. Noting President Bush's "ambitious goal" to
reduce greenhouse gas intensity by 18 percent from 2002-2012, he noted
progress to date, with slightly lower emissions in 2003 than 2000 in
spite of population growth and a significant rise in gross domestic
product (GDP). He emphasized the US commitment to engaging fully at the
international level and to sustainable development, noting initiatives
on carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, nuclear energy and methane
recovery and use.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">DISCUSSION: </font></b><font size="2">Responding to a
question from Luxembourg about existing technologies, Harlan Watson
agreed that these had an important role. In response to a comment from
Bolivia on the role of forestry in reducing climate change impacts,
Artur Runge-Metzger noted that the sector was only partially dealt with
under the Kyoto Protocol, as deforestation was not adequately addressed.
Harlan Watson emphasized sequestration focused on forests and farmland.
Harald Dovland noted that he had not been especially satisfied with how
forestry and sinks issues had been addressed under the Kyoto Protocol,
and hoped that in future regimes they would be dealt with through
constructive discussions. Alf Wills noted concerns that South Africa's
particular conditions, including its water limitations, meant forestry
issues are considered more in terms of vulnerability and adaptation than
carbon sinks. </font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Responding to Bulgaria's question about the exclusion of aviation from
the Kyoto Protocol, Artur Runge-Metzger said the European Commission was
considering this complex issue, and that aviation should be addressed in
a future climate regime. Harlan Watson noted that the aviation sector is
experiencing growth in some parts of the world, although not in the US.
Harold Dovland noted discussions on this issue in the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the EU.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Indonesia asked about the post-2012 period. Artur Runge-Metzger
indicated that neither the EU ETS Directive nor the Linking Directive to
the CDM and JI have an expiration date. Harold Dovland said care must be
taken not to establish a regime that is so complex that compliance
cannot be monitored effectively. He expressed a personal view that a
future framework should involve multiple stakeholders, rather than "the
dichotomous world of Annex I and non-Annex I" Parties.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Headline3" align="justify"><b><i>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">SESSION THREE</font></i></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This
session, which took place on Monday afternoon, included speeches from
Tuvalu, Albania, the Republic of Korea and the Netherlands, as well as a
question-and-answer session.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">PRESENTATIONS:</font></b><font size="2"> <b>Tuvalu:</b>
Ian Fry said Annex B countries should focus on energy efficiency and
renewable energy and that countries that are not Parties to the Kyoto
Protocol should reduce their emissions levels. He called for a renewable
energy and energy efficiency technology fund to assist non-Annex I
countries in reducing emissions and purchasing the necessary
technologies. He also opposed nuclear power as an option. Fry said
adaptation measures should focus both on building resistance to the
impacts of climate change, and on restoring the damage caused by its
impacts. He highlighted the need for a new financial facility for
adaptation funding, but said there was no need for an adaptation
protocol.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">Albania:</font></b><font size="2"> Ermira Fida said
Albania's First National Communication has been used to mainstream
climate change into national policies, including the development of the
national energy strategy and identifying ways to meet technology needs.
</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">Republic of Korea:</font></b><font size="2"> Boo Nam Shin
noted that energy demand is projected to grow both in the Republic of
Korea and globally. He highlighted international cooperation based on
the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and called
for the development and diffusion of more efficient technologies, and
technological assistance for non-Annex I countries.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">The Netherlands:</font></b><font size="2"> Yvo de Boer
speaking for the EU, focused on policy integration, noting increasing
energy consumption. He underscored the need to make emissions reductions
economically attractive, and to use the lessons learned from the Kyoto
Protocol. He said the international community should take advantage of
the synergies between combating climate change and achieving
development. </font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">DISCUSSION: </font></b><font size="2">In the subsequent
discussion,<b> </b>India asked for clarification on the new approaches
to differentiation among Parties, and Yvo de Boer said these should be
built on the UNFCCC framework. Pakistan highlighted the role of
renewable energy sources in economic empowerment of the poor and Samoa
stressed the importance of renewable energy technology transfer. Ian Fry
called for discussions on how to engage more effectively with
international financial institutions and to evolve in a way that meets
poverty reduction requirements as well as emissions reduction
requirements.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Headline3" align="justify"><b><i>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">SESSION FOUR</font></i></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This
session, which was held late Monday afternoon, included presentations
from Canada, Japan, Morocco and India, as well as a question-and-answer
session.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">PRESENTATIONS:</font></b><font size="2"> <b>Canada:</b>
Norine Smith reported on Project Green, which sets out steps to ensure
that Canada can meet its Kyoto commitments. She underscored Project
Green's focus on market mechanisms, a partnerships fund, large emitters,
information for Canadian consumers, carbon sequestration and
environmentally-sustainable infrastructure. She also highlighted
mounting evidence for climate change and a realization that that much
more needs to be done beyond Kyoto, with climate change already
occurring and affecting communities such as those in northern Canada.
Outlining preparations for COP-11/MOP-1 in Montreal, she drew attention
to the pre-meeting consultative process, welcoming advice and input to
help move the climate process forward and to operationalize the Kyoto
Protocol. </font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">Japan:</font></b><font size="2"> Mutsuyoshi Nishimura
drew attention to Japan's new plan to implement its Kyoto commitments,
describing it as a "huge package" of measures involving various
stakeholders. Stressing that climate change is real and that delays in
dealing with it will lead to further damage, he highlighted
technological innovation, on which Japan has taken a leading role, and
also advocated global action. He supported a free and frank dialogue and
a "new paradigm" that was "encouraging and enabling" rather than
"capping and punishing." He supported a roadmap to a low carbon society.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">Morocco</font></b><font size="2">: Taha Balafrej
highlighted Morocco's vulnerability to climate change, including its
impact on precipitation and water supply. On the way forward, he said
Morocco would entertain any proposal to combat global warming in a
substantial way. He stressed that commitments from all developed
countries are needed, highlighted business sector concerns about the
economic impacts of climate change, suggested making this process less
complicated and more flexible, and called for procedures for the CDM to
be streamlined. He also urged greater efforts on adaptation.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">India:</font></b><font size="2"> Surya P. Sethi stated
that emissions in Annex I countries are rising and that their reductions
have not resulted from new climate policies and measures but from "one
time" events such as the economic transition in Eastern Europe, and the
shift from coal to gas in the UK. He emphasized the limits of different
models forecasting emissions trends and drew attention to the barriers
to technology transfer and financing. He noted that India's low
emissions levels do not result only from poverty but that they can also
be attributed to lifestyle choices.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">DISCUSSION: </font></b><font size="2">Responding to
questions from various participants concerning technology transfer,
Surya P. Sethi highlighted that the transfer of certain technologies
should be moved to the public domain, as the speed of
commercially-driven technology transfer will be insufficient to affect
climate change in any meaningful way, due to the lack of resources in
developing countries. Taha Balafrej underscored the need to have a clear
picture of the efforts made to date by developed countries, and the
results achieved. He noted the need to improve the system and equity in
CDM project distribution, emphasizing Africa's under-representation.
Responding to a question from Germany on the inclusion of the private
sector in reducing carbon emissions, Mutsuyoshi Nishimura explained
about Japan's voluntary programme and Norine Smith reported on Canada's
consultation with large emitters, which resulted in an emissions
intensity approach. Responding to a question from the UK on their
long-term climate policy perspectives, Mutsuyoshi Nishimura and Norine
Smith underscored that long-term planning is needed to secure the
necessary investments in infrastructure. Mutsuyoshi Nishimura noted
Japan's significant investments in energy efficiency and conservation
over many years. Norine Smith said the similarities in different
countries' approaches probably reflect the influence of academic
literature.</font></font></p>

Tuesday morning, 17 May, delegates heard presentations from government
experts from Papua New Guinea, Mexico, Australia and France, and engaged
in a question-and-answer session. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">PRESENTATIONS: Papua New Guinea:</font></b><font size="2">
Robert G. Aisi underscored that the Kyoto Protocol excludes action by
developing countries to avoid deforestation. He proposed an optional
protocol with tradable credits issued against avoided deforestation, and
questioned whether the Marrakesh Accords should be amended.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">Mexico:</font></b><font size="2"> Fernando Tudela said a
signal should be given to the markets on the future of the climate
regime, and raised the possibility of a "Montreal Mandate" at
COP-11/MOP-1. He suggested that further differentiation among developing
countries was necessary, and introduced the idea of flexible convergence
of <i>per capita</i> emissions. While noting some positive aspects of
the CDM, he listed various concerns, including transaction costs and an
imbalance between environmental integrity and effectiveness.  </font>
</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">Australia:</font></b><font size="2"> Jan Adams said the
major emitters should take action to reduce emissions and identified the
growing global energy demand as a major challenge. She highlighted
cooperation on the development of both renewable energy and cleaner
fossil fuel technologies, and identified thermal power generation,
carbon sequestration and clean coal technologies as promising
alternatives.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">France:</font></b><font size="2"> Paul Watkinson, on
behalf of the EU, focused on the investment challenge. He highlighted
the need to influence private investment decisions and emphasized the
importance of integrating climate in other policies, the role of trade
regimes and the World Trade Organization, and noted that post-2012
uncertainty is already affecting carbon markets. </font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">DISCUSSION: </font></b><font size="2">In the ensuing
discussion,<b> </b>Monaco said <i>per capita</i> emissions should be a
relevant consideration in determining future commitments. Egypt, the
Russian Federation, Monaco and others underscored problems with the CDM,
including its complexity. Morocco noted that, while the CDM needs to be
improved, it does link action on climate change to development. Fernando
Tudela suggested that the CDM could focus on economic sectors and that
sectoral baselines be developed. </font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Hungary and Japan asked what was meant by differentiation among
developing countries, and Fernando Tudela replied that if a country can
do more to reduce emissions then it should do so, thus avoiding a "race
to the bottom." Morocco proposed that the Secretariat put up a Carbon
Thermometer on its website, based on Annex I national contributions, to
increase the visibility of carbon emissions. The Russian Federation
highlighted the need for post-2012 certainty to encourage private sector
investment. Tuvalu raised the issue of small developing country
participation in the climate process. Paul Watkinson observed that, as a
result of the EU ETS, businesses in the EU are aware of their emissions
levels. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Headline3" align="justify"><b><i>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">SESSION SIX</font></i></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On
Tuesday morning, delegates heard presentations from New Zealand,
Germany, Argentina and Finland, and engaged in a question-and-answer
session. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">PRESENTATIONS: New Zealand:</font></b><font size="2">
Helen Plume noted her country's responses to climate change, including a
carbon tax to be introduced in 2007. She drew attention to New Zealand's
unique circumstances and highlighted the need for flexible solutions,
while emphasizing that all the major emitters should be involved in the
process and that broad participation is essential. </font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">Germany:</font></b><font size="2"> Karsten Sach, on
behalf of the EU, spoke about technology and innovation. Highlighting
the need to find ways to bring technologies to the market, he outlined a
range of "push and pull" policies, and discussed the role of
public-private partnerships. He said the Kyoto framework serves as a
good basis for the post-2012 period, and stressed that there should be
no gap in the process. </font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">Argentina: </font></b><font size="2">Vicente R. Barros
acknowledged warnings about the 2˚C global warming threshold, and noted
that warming is expected to be greater in some tropical and sub-tropical
areas, with impacts on, <i>inter alia</i>, precipitation, water
supplies, hydro power and agriculture. He stressed the importance of
taking action on the post-2012 period, arguing that "we must start now"
to discuss these issues. He highlighted the importance of the CDM and
said its scope should be expanded. He also discussed the important roles
of carbon sequestration and reforestation. </font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">Finland:</font></b><font size="2"> Outi Berghäll stressed
the urgency of adaptation, and called for the integration of climate
change and adaptation into development policies, as well as into
national and subnational decision-making. She emphasized the need to
enhance cross-sectoral communication, avoid duplication of efforts, and
find synergies between international institutions and other multilateral
environmental agreements. </font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">DISCUSSION: </font></b><font size="2">Responding to a
question from Hungary on long-term goals, Helen Plume indicated that New
Zealand has not adopted a long-term global warming target, but accepted
that international consensus on such a target would provide greater
certainty for the business sector. Responding to a question from
Pakistan, Karsten Sach highlighted the value of networking to promote
renewable energy, and agreed with Kenya on the need to build capacity
for Africa to participate more effectively in the CDM. Vicente R. Barros
identified the need for mechanisms to encourage larger emissions
reductions and further develop the CDM. Responding to Kenya, Outi
Berghäll said the recognition of differences in the impacts of climate
change on countries must be the starting point for adaptation, and that
responses must be tailored to fit national circumstances.   </font>

<p class="ENB-Headline3" align="justify"><b><i>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESENTATIONS FROM CIVIL SOCIETY</font></i></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Representatives of civil society groups were invited to speak early on
Tuesday afternoon.<b> </b>Nick Campbell, representing the business and
industry organizations at the Seminar, emphasized the willingness of the
business community to continue to participate in climate efforts and
urged Parties to consider the wider impacts of climate policies.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sanjay
Vashist, Climate Action Network, underscored that climate change is
already having an impact, and said a mandate for negotiations on the
post-2012 period must come out of COP-11/MOP-1 in Montreal. He urged
limiting warming to under 2˚C compared with pre-industrial levels. He
said a future framework should address issues such as access to clean
technologies, justice and equity, new financing, and adaptation. He
argued that "we cannot delude ourselves that we can engage the US at
this point," and should begin discussions immediately to ensure
continuity between the first and second commitment periods. He also
urged India to take a "fresh approach" and support a Montreal mandate.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Saleemul Huq, on behalf of Research and Independent Non-Governmental
Organizations (RINGOs), supported a more robust response to climate
change, and strengthened action on mitigation and adaptation. He said
RINGOs are committed to this process and contributing as it moves
forward in the direction agreed by Parties.</font></p>

<font size="2" face="Verdana">SESSION SEVEN</font></i></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On
Tuesday afternoon, delegates heard presentations from representatives of
Peru, Mali and Saudi Arabia, and engaged in a question-and-answer
session. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">PRESENTATIONS: Peru: </font></b><font size="2">María Paz
Cigarán focused on practical action to address climate change at the
national level. She elaborated on public awareness campaigns and
adaptation issues, noting that adaptation is local but needs
international support. She underscored the need to identify critical
actors and target audiences for public awareness campaigns, noting their
campaign slogan: "Climate is changing, so should we."</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">Mali:</font></b><font size="2"> Mama Konate elaborated on
Mali's national monitoring plans and meteorological information systems
to provide weather information to farmers, which are an example of local
adaptation and allow rural population to take action. </font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">Saudi Arabia:</font></b><font size="2"> Fareed Al-Asaly
said Annex I Parties are not fulfilling their commitments under the
UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol, particularly in reducing emissions or
providing assistance and technology transfer. He underscored that
international action should be based on the articles of the UNFCCC, and
stating that the Buenos Aires Programme on Adaptation was inadequate, he
called for a focus on modeling, insurance and economic diversification.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">DISCUSSION:</font></b><font size="2"> Namibia, Burkina
Faso, Togo and others expressed interest in Mali's experiences with
national monitoring plans and meteorological information systems, and
raised the idea of turning them into a regional programme. Egypt and
Malaysia stressed the importance of technology transfer and the role of
the private sector in technology transfer. The Russian Federation
highlighted the need for better forecasts on the consequences of climate
change, together with historical and long-term perspectives. </font>
</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Responding to a question from France about adaptation, María Paz Cigarán
said it is very difficult to generalize about the experiences of
different countries because of their diverse circumstances. She
indicated that, at present, focusing on capacity building against
climate variability would be the most beneficial action, along with
dissemination of information. Mama Konate said Mali's information system
is an example that can be applied to any developing country. Fareed Al-Asaly
said that, at present, the development of cleaner fossil fuel
technologies tends to focus on coal, whereas Saudi Arabia would like to
see similar efforts put into oil technologies. Responding to Nigeria,
the UK, Algeria and Hungary on economic diversification, Fareed Al-Asaly
said Saudi Arabia is focusing its economic diversification efforts on
the petrochemical sector, while in terms of adaptation, the emphasis is
on coastal zone management.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Headline3" align="justify"><b><i>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">CLOSING SESSION</font></i></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Co-Chair Chow Kok Kee opened the closing session late Tuesday afternoon.
Observing that the Seminar had produced some very fruitful discussions,
he asked experts to present their views on three key issues: technology
transfer, adaptation and mitigation. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Reflecting on the Seminar, several participants were positive about the
open, frank discussions that had taken place. Luxembourg, on behalf of
the EU, identified a "large consensus" among delegations on the common
challenges ahead. He noted the EU's determination to reinvigorate
discussions on the post-2012 period and looked forward to further steps
in Montreal at COP-11/MOP-1. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER:</font></b><font size="2"> On
technology transfer, participants commented on how to increase the flow
of technology transfer and improve the effectiveness of the Kyoto
Mechanisms. Canada supported strategies targeted at specific
technologies. The US noted the framework agreed under the Marrakesh
Accords. He questioned calls for new mechanisms, and praised the Expert
Group on Technology Transfer on its work to date. He also highlighted
the focus on public-private partnerships. Tuvalu suggested a new funding
mechanism to support technology transfer.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the
CDM, Botswana said procedures needed to be simplified. China highlighted
difficulties with the CDM, and suggested strengthening it and
considering additional options. Nigeria highlighted the CDM's role in
catalyzing technology transfer, supported strengthening the CDM, and
stressed the importance of technology needs assessments. Canada offered
to host an informal workshop on the CDM prior to COP-11/MOP-1, possibly
in September 2005. Germany said the CDM should be strengthened without
renegotiating the Marrakesh Accords. Qatar emphasized a strong
compliance system with financial penalties as a means to ensure an
active CDM market. Uganda said the renegotiation of CDM modalities would
be too slow, and drew attention to problems caused by the
commercially-driven nature of technology transfer.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Calling for a signal to the market on post-2012 commitments, Bulgaria
highlighted the success of JI and described the Green Investment Scheme,
suggesting that Parties develop guidelines for this new mechanism if
necessary. Algeria lamented the complexity of the CDM procedure.
Indonesia said stricter emissions targets for industrialized countries
would speed up technology transfer by reducing the cost of
climate-friendly technologies, and emphasized that the sustainability of
lifestyles was more important than technology. On the CDM, Indonesia
said ways should be found to make transport projects and projects that
specifically reduce carbon dioxide emissions more attractive. Kenya
suggested measures to encourage manufacturing in developing countries,
and called for changes to the CDM to ensure the equitable distribution
of projects. Bangladesh noted that allowing the market to drive CDM
investment concentrates projects in countries with better
infrastructure, and called for a mechanism to guarantee wider
distribution of CDM projects.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">ADAPTATION:</font></b><font size="2"> Participants were
then asked to discuss adaptation issues. Finland underscored that
mitigation is the key to tackling climate change, but said adaptation is
also required. She stressed that adaptation and mitigation are
complementary, not alternative actions, and that the international
approach to adaptation should be different to that on mitigation.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">India
emphasized that adaptation measures should not attempt to replicate
mitigation models, such as incremental costs. Senegal said technology
transfer should be integrated into political decision making, and
stressed the need for information transfer and scientific cooperation.
Japan and Bangladesh emphasized the need to enhance monitoring and
assessment of climate impacts and vulnerability. Bangladesh underscored
the need to integrate disaster management into adaptation strategies.
Botswana stressed the importance of public awareness on adaptation.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">MITIGATION: </font></b><font size="2">On mitigation,<b>
</b>the<b> </b>Republic of Korea highlighted common but differentiated
responsibilities and noted that, given the current global reliance on
fossil fuels, it was time to look at the nuclear energy option more
positively. He also said economic considerations should help guide
discussions on the post-2012 period.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Canada
said the key question now was how to move forward in a way that builds
constructively on the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol. She noted similarities
in the way many countries are addressing the climate change problem, and
felt that there was a great deal of scope for pooling efforts across
countries and sectors. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Luxembourg, on behalf of the EU, supported seeking synergies between
combating climate change and sustainable development objectives, and
said EU Heads of State had agreed to restrict warming to within the 2˚C
threshold. The UK highlighted benefits of taking both a long-term and
short-term approach, noting that its ambitious long-term goal had
provided a context and incentive for short-term action. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Saudi
Arabia said the UNFCCC has set out a clear approach on mitigation and
Parties should meet their obligations. India highlighted the issue of
how to shape development policies in ways that produce co-benefits on
climate change. He noted that developing countries are already
implementing extensive and successful packages of measures on climate
change. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">CLOSING REMARKS: </font></b><font size="2">Responding to
questions about the outcome of the Seminar, UNFCCC Executive Secretary
Joke Waller-Hunter noted that COP-10 had invited the Secretariat to make
the proceedings of the Seminar available. She indicated that a video
webcast of the proceedings is available online, and said a compilation
of all the presentations and discussions would be prepared
(http://unfccc.int/meetings/seminar/items/3410.php). This would be
descriptive and factual, but would contain no interpretation of events.
</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Co-Chair Masaki Konishi indicated that the Seminar had produced a
"useful and constructive exchange of information on a wide range of
issues." He said a lot of information had been exchanged, and it should
help make individual and collective efforts more efficient, and create
confidence among Parties. He thanked all participants, and expressed the
hope that the Seminar had helped pave the way for COP-11/MOP-1. He
expressed his gratitude to the Secretariat, interpreters, and the German
Government for hosting the meeting, and everyone who had made it
possible for the Seminar to take place. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Co-Chair Chow Kok Kee noted the frank exchange of information, and
congratulated participants on their upbeat and positive approach. He
said he detected a common vision, adding that, although "we may take 100
different paths," he hoped they would all end up achieving the same goal
of combating climate change on the road to sustainable development. He
declared the Seminar closed shortly after 7:00 pm.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Headline2" align="center"><b>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE SEMINAR</font></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">"This
Seminar is the first of its kind in UNFCCC history. [But] time will
tell if it will be remembered as an historic event," observed UNFCCC
Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter at the opening of the Seminar of
Governmental Experts on Monday morning, 16 May. Waller-Hunter's comments
reflected the sentiments of the participants as the meeting began. Many
were unsure of exactly what to expect from the Seminar. This uncertainty
was due in large part to the importance and sensitivity of the issues
many participants hoped to discuss. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The
decision to hold the Seminar was taken at COP-10 in December 2004,
following heated discussions on how to engage on some of the broader
issues facing the climate change process. Foremost among these issues
for some Parties was the future framework and commitments to combat
climate change in the post-2012 period. Developing countries were
sensitive to attempts to discuss emissions targets for non-Annex I
Parties, and there was also the difficult question of how to include
non-Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in talks on subsequent commitments. In
addition, there was interest in other issues, such as the increasingly
strong evidence of climate change, differences of opinion over Kyoto's
future, and mitigation and adaptation. As a result of these concerns and
sensitivities, the terms of reference set for the Seminar were left both
broad and, in some countries' opinions, quite vague. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Headline3" align="justify"><b><i>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">FRANK DIALOGUE AND THE "COMFY ARMCHAIR
THEORY"</font></i></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Given
the difficulties at COP-10 during the discussions on the Seminar and its
mandate, most participants seemed pleasantly surprised by the positive
atmosphere as the Seminar began. Several participants felt that the
relaxed setting played its part. The Seminar's Co-Chairs, Japan's Masaki
Konishi and Malaysia's Chow Kok Kee, adopted a laid-back approach that
seemed to put participants at ease. In addition, many delegates
commented on the comfortable red armchairs placed on the stage for the
government experts. The podium was lowered to make it more on a level
with participants – again to lessen the formality of the occasion. Some
compared it to a "television talk show" setting, while others likened
the use of "comfy chairs" and the informal approach to a "nice fireside
chat."</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Whether or not these organizational details were instrumental in
generating the positive atmosphere, the dialogue was certainly open,
frank and broad-ranging. There was a free exchange of information on
actions countries are taking on mitigation and adaptation, and to
support implementation of commitments under the UNFCCC and Kyoto
Protocol. There were also no objections when speakers began discussing
the post-2012 period and other previously-sensitive issues.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In an
unusual departure from previous climate change meetings, participants
appeared open to discussing not only what their positions are, but also
the concerns underlying these positions. There was considerable
discussion on national circumstances, and many observers noted a desire
to understand other Parties' positions and preoccupations. One
participant suggested that the broad terms of reference for the meeting,
and the fact that it was not linked to any specific agenda item, had
allowed speakers to think and talk "outside the box." </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Headline3" align="justify"><b><i>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">SUBSTANCE AND STYLE</font></i></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As
well as the "user-friendly" organizational style, many observers were
also pleased with the substantive nature of the discussions, noting the
focus on issues rather than procedure. Controversial issues were
discussed openly. These included free-flowing debates on technology
transfer, the benefits and shortcomings of the CDM, adaptation and
mitigation, and even nuclear energy.   </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Discussions about technology played an important role in the Seminar. On
technology transfer issues, developing nations articulated a clear
desire for a greater commitment on this issue on the part of
industrialized countries. Participants generally saw the CDM as a
positive and innovative contribution, but they also recognized the need
to review and streamline the procedures and expand the mechanism's
scope. They also focused attention on the need to develop new
technologies. Some observers detected a greater willingness to engage on
technology issues that the United States and some other countries have
focused on recently, including carbon sequestration and "clean" fossils
fuels.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Many
experts emphasized the financial aspects of addressing climate change,
especially the need to ensure that actions provide economic
opportunities and are cost-effective. Again, some felt this reflected a
desire to accommodate the perspectives of those who had criticized Kyoto
on economic grounds. Business and industry's desire for long-term
certainty was stressed repeatedly, as were companies' concerns about
their inability to plan properly with the post-2012 framework still so
unclear. There appeared to be consensus that such uncertainty was bad
for long-term investment. Many Parties also stressed the increasing
evidence about the economic impacts of climate change, which several
participants felt contributed towards the more open dialogue at the
Seminar. In particular, recent meetings affirming the dangers of
allowing temperatures to rise more than 2˚C above pre-industrial levels
seemed to have strengthened many Parties' conviction that urgent action
is needed.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Another message from the Seminar was the long time-lag for translating
political decisions into effective policy. This view seemed to inspire a
greater openness to talking about the post-2012 period. Some Parties
clearly hoped for a "Montreal Mandate" from COP/MOP-1 that would lay out
a roadmap for the post-2012 negotiation phase. Whether that road makes
its way directly through Kyoto territory, within the UNFCCC framework,
or heads down several different paths, was a question most Parties were
careful to avoid. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With
COP/MOP-1 still six months away, the outcome and potential for a
"Montreal Mandate" is far from clear. While there was definitely a
constructive dialogue at the Seminar, some observers felt that there
were few signs that the differences between Parties had actually
narrowed, and that these differences could soon translate once more into
heated discussions and intransigence once formal negotiations resumed.
On the other hand, few would disagree that the Seminar built confidence
and demonstrated a willingness to understand other positions and
circumstances, and even begin the search for innovative ways to
accommodate them. One participant summed it up as "just a small first
step in a new phase for the climate process," but quickly added that,
"at least the step was in the right direction."</font></p>

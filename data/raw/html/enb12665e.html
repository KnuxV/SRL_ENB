<p>
</p><p>On Friday, 22 April 2016, the signing ceremony for the Paris Agreement on Climate Change took place at UN Headquarters in New York. Following an opening ceremony, 175 countries signed the Paris Agreement, the largest number of countries to ever sign a multilateral agreement on the day on which it opens for signature. After signing the Agreement, Heads of State and Government delivered national statements, addressing their intention to ratify and/or outlining their national climate change policies and actions.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, a high-level special event addressed the theme “Taking climate action to the next level: Realizing the vision of the Paris Agreement.” The day ended with delegates hearing statements from past, present and future presidents of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP), and an address by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. </p>
<p><strong><em>OPENING CEREMONY</em></strong></p>
<p>The signing ceremony for the Paris Agreement opened with a performance from students from the Julliard School. UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon opened the ceremony. Getrude Clement, a youth representative from Tanzania, stressed the need for countries to go beyond words to action to address climate change, highlighted youth-driven awareness raising efforts in her country, and underlined the need for urgent large-scale climate action to secure the future of young people.</p>
<p>UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon then welcomed the 175 countries gathered in New York to sign the Paris Agreement on climate change, stressing that it is the largest number of world leaders in history signing an international agreement in one day. He then saluted the countries depositing instruments of ratification including: Barbados, Belize, Fiji, Grenada, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Nauru, Palau, State of Palestine, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Samoa, Somalia and Tuvalu.</p>
<p>French President François Hollande said nations need to go beyond the pledges made in the run up to the Paris Agreement and ensure that words become actions. He urged rapid ratification, saying he would request his parliament to ratify the Agreement by “this summer,” and expressing hope the European Union (EU) would do so by the end of 2016. He committed France to setting a price for carbon and urged rapid and ambitious mobilization of resources, pledging to raise France’s contribution to €5 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>UN General Assembly President Mogens Lykketoft congratulated Heads of State and Government, civil society, as well as the Secretary-General and the UNFCCC Secretariat for their efforts leading to the Paris Agreement, and underlined the need to raise the level of ambition in national commitments in the years to come.</p>
<p>Drawing attention to the weighty obligations contained in the Paris Agreement, which are in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR), Ollanta Humala, President of Peru, highlighted the importance of maintaining the momentum set by the Lima-Paris Action Agenda in the run-up to COP 22, and called for international cooperation to ramp up climate financing to assist developing countries to invest in low-carbon growth.</p>
<p>Joseph Kabila, President, Democratic Republic of Congo, on behalf of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), supported an intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) review every five years. He described his country’s plans to reduce CO2 emissions by 17% between 2020 and 2030, and said his country will make all efforts to maintain temperature rise below 1.5°C degrees by the end of the century.</p>
<p>Evo Morales, President, Bolivia, noting that this day marks Earth Day, said that the Paris Agreement is only a first step, whereas saving Mother Earth will require eradicating the threats posed by the capitalist system. He called for an international charter of the rights of Mother Earth, and the establishment of an international tribunal of Earth justice.</p>
<p>Committing to support the prompt entry into force of the Paris Agreement, Dilma Rousseff, President, Brazil, called for cooperative climate action, stressing the need for developed countries to increase their ambition and move beyond US$100 billion a year in order to ensure developing countries can meet their obligations under the Agreement. She highlighted her country’s efforts to reforest 12 million hectares of deforested lands, and 15 million hectares of degraded lands, and called attention to efforts to substantially increase the share of renewable energy in the national energy mix.</p>
<p>Zhang Gaoli, Vice Premier, China announced that China will ratify the Paris Agreement before the G20 Summit in September 2016, ensuring its early entry into force. He added that China plans to: reduce the carbon intensity of its GDP by 18% in the next five years; achieve the peaking of its CO2 emissions around 2030 and take actions to peak early; and implement a strict national accountability system for environmental protection.</p>
<p>After describing efforts to invest in low-carbon and clean energy technologies at home, Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister, Canada, said his country is committed to helping developing countries, “since they should not be punished for a problem they did not create.” He pledged US$2.56 billion to assist developing countries to grow in a cleaner, more sustainable manner. He also said he would submit the Agreement to his parliament next month with a view to ratify it later this year.</p>
<p>Matteo Renzi, Prime Minister, Italy, drew attention to the importance of cooperation within the international community in sending a political message of hope to the world at the signing ceremony, stressing that “today is a great day of hope for the next generation.”</p>
<p>Enele Sosene Sopoaga, Prime Minister, Tuvalu, announced his parliament’s assent to ratify the Paris agreement.  He welcomed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related greenhouse gas (GHG) emission pathways. He drew attention to the rights of migrants in the preamble of the Paris Agreement; expressed concern regarding climate-related displacements; and stressed the need to avoid conditioning the access to climate financing by how well a country can write its adaption proposal.</p>
<p>Alexander Khloponin, Deputy Prime Minister, Russian Federation, said Russia was looking forward to the negotiations on guidelines under the Agreement for the use of market mechanisms. He described his country’s efforts to prepare a national plan to implement the Agreement. He also recalled President Putin’s proposal to convene a scientific forum under UN auspices to discuss climate, the depletion of natural resources, and degradation of the human habitat.</p>
<p>Invoking John F. Kennedy’s words that “Here on Earth, God’s work must truly be our own,” John Kerry, United States Secretary of State, stressed the need for political resolve to match the ambition of the Paris Agreement, noting that the Agreement sends important signals to the marketplace and to governments to redefine a new energy future, and calling on governments to recommit to winning the war against climate change.</p>

<p>Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Singapore, said the Paris Agreement will transform the development paradigm from short-term to long-term, from exploitation of the weak and vulnerable to justice for all, and from gambling with our children’s future to global resilience. He called for pre-2020 actions to create a strong foundation for post-2020 actions.</p>
<p>Ramón Jesús P. Paje, Secretary for the Environment and Natural Resources, Philippines, said it is cascading mitigation and adaptation actions to the local level and investing in climate resilient economies, while also developing a GHG management and reporting system to create an accurate, transparent and comparable baseline of emissions. </p>
<p>Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth, Minister for Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Climate Change, United Kingdom, cited his country’s “proud record” towards reducing emissions by 80% by 2050. As part of the EU, the UK submitted its INDC before any other major economy, he added. He announced a contribution of £10 million to the capacity-building initiative for transparency and that the UK is working with industry to green private finance and investment flows. </p>
<p>Abdoulaye Diop, Minister for Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and African Integration, Mali, said his country expects to play an active and constructive role in implementation as a LLDC in the Sahel that faces numerous challenges, including desertification. He expressed hope that the commitments for financing activities to combat climate change be respected, since this will enable the most vulnerable to strengthen resilience. He said that Mali’s mitigation plan promotes use of renewable energy and energy efficiency. He added that Mali will proceed with ratification later this month.</p>
<p>Bomo Edith Edna Molewa, Minister for Environmental Affairs, South Africa, said that it has already commenced the domestic ratification process. She said that South Africa has put in place a climate change response policy with a mitigation and adaptation framework to achieve the goals in its national development plan. The first five-year cycle includes a carbon budget for each company, pollution prevention plans, a reporting system, and other incentive and disincentive measures. She called for closing the mitigation, adaptation and financing gaps. </p>
<p>“All of the ice in the world is melting,” said Paul Herbert Oquist Kelley, Minister and Private Secretary for National Policies, Nicaragua, describing the impacts of only a 1°C rise in global temperature above pre-industrial levels. He said SDG 13 calls for “urgent action” to combat climate change and its impacts, but the Paris Agreement does not take urgent action, such as stopping temperature rise at 2°C. Nor does it provide financing to compensate losses or legal consequences for those who have caused climate change. Among other “dangers inherent in the Paris Agreement,” he lamented the quickly-gaveled change of “shall” to “should” with regard to CBDR, which denies developing countries their legal rights to damages. In sum, the Agreement creates a “new neocolonial asymmetry” in which developing countries are held responsible for their obligations and acts while developed countries’ historical responsibilities are pardoned. Nicaragua will not sign the Paris Agreement in hope of exerting pressure on other countries to avoid a world of a 3°C temperature rise, he said.</p>
<p>Camillo Gonsalves, Minister for Economic Planning, Sustainable Development, Industry, Information and Labour, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, urged signatories to ratify the Paris Agreement as quickly as legislatively permissible. He said the Agreement is “not perfect, but it is perfectible.” Observing that climate finance is poorly defined in the Agreement, he expressed hope that the sword of enforcement will be wielded by a unified international community, concluding that success will be measured in both “dollars and degrees.” </p>
<p>Paula Bennett, Minister for Climate Change Issues, New Zealand, said methane comprises a large share of her country’s emissions, so it must mitigate those without hurting agriculture. She also highlighted New Zealand’s support for Pacific neighbors to adopt solar and other clean energies, its support for the role of carbon markets, and an ongoing review of New Zealand’s emissions trading scheme. She added that the price of carbon needs to be higher.</p>
<p>Cristiana Pasca Palmer, Minister for the Environment, Water and Forests, Romania, said it has a new 2030 strategy and action plan to address climate change challenges and to build sustainable development pathways, which includes civil society and stakeholder participation to prepare its people to cope with impact of climate change. Romania is also taking steps to contribute to the GCF this year.</p>
<p>Khemais Jhinaoui, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tunisia, said that its NDC has been determined at an ambitious level. Further carbon emissions reductions in Tunisia are contingent upon financing, technology transfer and capacity building in adaptation and mitigation. He added that in September, Tunisia will host consultations with the UNFCCC and the UN Development Programme (UNDP), which will focus on measures related to the contribution of African nations in the mitigation of climate change impacts. </p>
<p>Louise Mushikiwabo, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, Rwanda, said while the Paris Agreement is a historic step in the right direction, we cannot be content with the signing, since the real work must now begin. She described Rwanda’s Green Fund, an investment fund and the largest of its kind in Africa, which invests in the best public and private projects and has mobilized US$1 million. </p>
<p>Aslov Sirodjidin Muhridinovich, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tajikistan, said Central Asia is already experiencing effects from the 1°C rise in temperature, including increased precipitation and intensity of disasters. He said Tajikistan has adopted a national plan of action to mitigate climate impacts, and that regular monitoring and adaptation measures will benefit mountain ecosystems. He called on developed countries, UN agencies, and “reputable” international financial institutions to continue cooperation efforts to address mitigation and adaptation.</p>
<p>A cultural revolution must accompany policies and actions, said San Marino, highlighting education in schools as well as the construction sector. She said her country is working on non-polluting methods of transport and legislative provisions to upgrade buildings’ energy-efficiency. San Marino thanked the planet’s “most sensitive inhabitants” for their pressure to realize the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>Susil Premajayantha, Minister for Science, Technology and Research, Sri Lanka, said that shortly after Paris it began its transformation to a low-carbon economy. The country will set up climate-resilient villages and climate-smart cities, and it aims for 20% renewables by 2020, he said. He called for international support and assistance to implement national strategies, priorities and needs on mitigation, adaptation and mobilizing climate finance.</p>
<p>Yoon Seong-kyu, Minister for the Environment, Republic of Korea, announced that it will take necessary measures for ratification. He described domestic actions that are the building blocks for a low-carbon future, including its nationwide carbon trading scheme that started last year and its national adaptation plan. He said that the Republic of Korea is introducing other innovative climate policies and is happy to share its experience with other countries.</p>
<p>João Pedro Matos Fernandes, Minister for the Environment, Portugal, said his country: has a national climate change programme with emissions reduction targets of 30-40%; promotes renewable energies; is reducing dependency on energy imports; and has more efficient transportation. Portugal is also working with African Portuguese-speaking countries to help with implementation.</p>
<p>Vidar Helgesen, Minister for Climate and the Environment, Norway, said he expects his country to ratify the Paris Agreement by June. He said that Norway’s climate target is a 40% reduction by 2030 compared with 1990 levels with a goal for carbon neutrality by 2050. The petroleum industry has been the center of Norway’s economy for decades but, he said, this is about to change. He said that transformation means opportunities not just challenges. He called for sufficient ratifications this year for the Paris Agreement to enter into force and achieve its ambitious targets.</p>
<p>Thani Ahmed Al-Zeyoudi, Minister for Climate Change and the Environment, United Arab Emirates, said the work over the next five years will be as important as that done in Paris.

His country is also enhancing public transport, reducing emissions from the transport and housing sectors, and striving for sustainable urban planning, he added.</p>
<p>Noting the urgency of action, Rafael Pacchiano Alamán, Minister for the Environment, Mexico, called for ensuring the Agreement enters into force as soon as possible. He said Mexico is promoting an international carbon price as well as international laws to reduce GHG emissions and short-lived air pollutants.</p>
<p>Ohn Winn, Minister for National Resources and Environmental Conservation, Myanmar, noted its vulnerability to cyclones, extreme droughts, and floods, saying climate resilience “remains our top priority.” He also: said Myanmar is developing a national climate change strategy; highlighted loss and damage; said finance is a crucial element of the Paris Agreement; and called for resources for the LDC Fund.</p>
<p>Tran Hong Ha, Minister for Natural Resources and the Environment, Viet Nam, called for finance, technology and capacity building to fully operationalize Paris Agreement commitments. He said that all countries should implement their INDCs. As a vulnerable country, he added that Viet Nam confirms its commitments to combat climate change and will implement the targets in its INDC. </p>
<p>Samura M.W. Kamara, Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Sierra Leone, said as one of the world’s most vulnerable countries, Sierra Leone is committed to abide by the Paris Agreement, has green growth as part of its development agenda; and is already implementing adaptation projects. But, he said, countries have a moral duty to work together so as not to pass on this danger to the next generation. </p>
<p>Mohammed Bin Abdullah Al-Rumaihi, Minister for Municipality and Environment, Qatar, reaffirmed its commitment to the efforts under the UNFCCC and the implementation of its INDCs.

He expressed hope the Paris Agreement will play a key role so that humanity can manage the effects that climate change presents.</p>
<p>James Fletcher, Minister for Sustainable Development, Energy, Science and Technology, Saint Lucia, said it will meet and possibly surpass its NDC by making investments in geothermal, wind and solar, while increasing energy efficiency, among other actions. He also outlined ways to “help countries like mine overcome the skepticism” that not enough will be done. He said developed country partners and UN agencies must fulfil their commitments and take actions to bend the curve toward 1.5 °C temperature rise, or less. He also called for new streams of climate financing for SIDS and other vulnerable nations. </p>
<p>Deng Deng Hoc Yai, Minister for the Environment, South Sudan, said we must be prepared to “pay money” for climate action, or “we will continue to pay with our lives.” He noted that since climate change is the biggest threat to the human race and the planet, finances should not be an obstacle to tackling it. </p>
<p>Battsereg Namdag, Minister for Environment, Green Development and Tourism, Mongolia, said that in January 2016, the government approved action plans to enforce policies on climate change. He noted that the need to increase technical assistance, expand international and regional financial mechanisms and other special funds for technology transfer and capacity building.</p>
<p>Milner Tozaka, Minister for Foreign Affairs and External Trade, Solomon Islands, thanked France for restoring confidence and trust in the multilateral system. However, he said, ambition in this agreement remains low and we need to enhance mitigation action to put us on a 1.5°C pathway. He said: investing in clean energy opens opportunities; they have submitted their NDC to reduce emissions by 27% by 2025; and hydropower and other projects need support. </p>
<p>Sharon Dijksma, Minister for Infrastructure and the Environment, the Netherlands, said the EU will double its reduction targets to at least 40% by 2030 and the Netherlands is already putting in place the relevant domestically binding legislation. She called for governments and industry to take up the challenge of reducing emissions from international aviation and maritime transport. She called for strong action on carbon pricing to achieve carbon neutrality and that the Netherlands will host a high-level dialogue on carbon pricing in the fall of this year. </p>
<p>Hassan Abdelgadir Hilal, Minister for the Environment, Forestry and Physical Development, Sudan, called for just and fair implementation of the Paris Agreement. He said that Sudan needs to attract international support and funding to implement the Paris Agreement. Sudan is developing solar, wind and hydro power, ending deforestation, and has a national adaptation plan. Sudan is working to do all of this with limited international support due to arbitrary measures of some countries, he added.</p>
<p>Constâncio da Conceição Pinto, Minister for Commerce, Industry and the Environment, Timor-Leste, said steps being taken by the LDCs and SIDS to address climate change must be matched by action from partners. He called on developed countries to take the lead in reducing emissions and fulfil long-standing pledges on means of implementation. He recognized a role for civil society, academia, media and the private sector in ensuring the Agreement’s success. He also reported that Timor Leste will submit its NDC after the signing ceremony, and will conduct a national implementation analysis as an input to its ratification process.</p>
<p>Niermala Badrising, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Suriname, noted that it is a “significantly carbon-negative” country and intends to maintain its forests and other natural and cultural resources, including by implementing REDD+ and a newly adopted energy bill to chart specific renewable energy strategies.</p>
<p>Dennis Moses, Minister for Foreign and Caribbean Community Affairs, Trinidad and Tobago, underscored the complementarity between the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development, and called for situating climate actions in a broader development paradigm. His country is aligning domestic development plans, including addressing climate change, with the SDGs and its NDC. As Trinidad and Tobago’s economy is largely energy-based, he said, it will maximize use of renewable energy, and is already setting up fiscal incentives and disincentives for deployment of alternative fuels and hybrid fuel technology in the transportation sector.</p>
<p>Mozambique said that common problems need global responses and this reaffirms the role of the UN in global governance. He said Mozambique’s vulnerability to climate change is undermining efforts to reduce poverty and promote economic and social development. He said Mozambique has submitted its INDC, is developing a multi-sectoral national strategy on mitigation and adaptation, and wants to do more and do it better, but the scarcity of resources is a problem.</p>
<p>Uruguay noted that 90% of the population lives on the coasts and the main economic activities, food production and tourism, are vulnerable to climate change. He said that Uruguay has implemented transformative policies to reduce carbon emissions and 97% of electricity comes from renewables. Uruguay is involving all stakeholders in dialogues to implement the Paris Agreement and will submit the Agreement to be ratified. </p>
<p>Turkmenistan said that national mitigation and adaptation plans are under development. She said that Turkmenistan plans to reduce the volume of GHG emissions using modern, clean and energy-efficient technologies and to stabilize the growth of emissions by 2030 to stay under a 2°C temperature rise. She called for stepping up multilateral cooperation and establishing a regional center on climate change in Central Asia in Turkmenistan. </p>
<p>Papua New Guinea said that his country provided the world’s first NDC, is one of a few countries that passed a climate change management act before the Paris Agreement was reached, and has embarked on its pre-2020 NDC. He said he is encouraged by Canada’s leadership and hopes other developed countries will follow its example.</p>
<p>Fatma Güldemet Sari, Minister for Environment and Urban Planning, Turkey, said the Agreement’s success will depend on realizing commitments to adequate funding and technology transfer. She called on developed countries to provide the means to transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient world economy. Turkey is a candidate to host the COP in 2020, a critical year for the Paris Agreement, she noted.</p>
<p>Tanzania said his country is “aware that our fate and prosperity are inextricably linked to climate change.” He highlighted Tanzania’s focus on forestry and the energy sector. He concluded that equity is crucial; “while climate change affects us all, it does not affect us all equally.”</p>
<p>Ukraine said that people can change the world if they stand together for a common future. He noted the negative environmental effects of the military invasion of Eastern Ukraine and said that Ukraine has signed the Paris Agreement to drive the change to a better and safer future. He called for implementation procedures in all countries, adding that together we can protect the planet for our children and future generations.</p>
<p><strong><em>TAKING CLIMATE ACTION TO THE NEXT LEVEL: REALIZING THE VISION OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT</em></strong></p>

<p>Governor Jerry Brown, State of California, US, said that California has two or three times more cars than years ago, but the air is much, much cleaner. He said California was the first state to regulate CO2 from automobiles and that law has now been transferred nationally. He noted the state’s leadership on renewable energy and noted that, while California is doing better than any other state, it will require further action. </p>
<p>Fernando Coimbra, Ministry of Environment, Brazil, highlighted his country’s efforts to address deforestation, noting that through international partnerships with Norway and Germany and stakeholder involvement his country has been successful in combating deforestation. He stressed the need for South-South cooperation, and offered to share experiences on deforestation with other forest basin countries.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Sachs, Director, Earth Institute, Columbia University, said his one key takeaway is to focus on low to no-carbon energy, with a 40-year perspective. He stressed there are a limited number of options, calling for systematic assessments of what is available and what can be done. He emphasized we are going to zero, and the path is not complicated because there are not that many options. He stressed that gas is not a stepping stone, it is another fossil fuel lock-in. He noted that nobody has undertaken the planning to get to zero and this planning has to take place. </p>
<p>Highlighting the work of the International Development Finance Club in mainstreaming climate finance and sustainable development and calling for bold leadership to implement the Paris Agreement, Patrick Dlamini, Development Bank of Southern Africa, described his bank’s efforts to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy, drawing attention to a renewable independent power-producer programme in South Africa set to produce 14000MW. </p>
<p>UNDP Administrator Helen Clark said there is much capacity to be built and climate change must be integrated into development plans, and there needs to be a single plan to accomplish sustainable development and climate change objectives. She called for the right mix of policies, institutions and regulatory environments. She also stressed climate action must be fair and equitable, noting women must be included. She emphasized the role of South-South cooperation and knowledge sharing, and discussed the need to support the transition of INDCs into NDCs. </p>
<p>Al Gore, Former Vice President, US, called for understandable information to allow the general public to be able to actively participate in the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and proposed an inter-regional “social-pressure” scheme to encourage countries to move towards greater energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Singer Akon highlighted his initiative, Akon Lighting Africa, noting his desire to be a part of something that will change the world. He said it works to galvanize the youth to support Africa’s future. He said innovation has to be the guiding rule, underscoring the importance of social change. He called for engaging finance and thinking outside of the box to support large scale financial flows. </p>
<p>Responding to a question on the transition to renewable energy and noting that energy transformation is more than just moving away from coal, Karsten Sach, Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety, Germany, noted that the transition is gradual, with the country working to create alternatives for coal miners, and workers in the fossil fuel sector; and drew attention to the country’s plan to be fossil-fuel-free by 2050.</p>
<p>Ajay Mathur, Director-General, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), stressed providing enough energy for all is a huge challenge, noting that this requires energy efficiency. He noted that developing countries have a huge advantage since much infrastructure has not yet been constructed and that if it is efficient it can be revolutionary. He highlighted policies that have made the cement industry the most energy efficient in the world, underscoring that institutional capacity matters in piloting and then rapidly scaling successful projects. </p>
<p>Princess Abzeita Djigma, Founder, Abze Solar, noted the importance of renewable energy technology expertise on the continent, describing her work to train workers in the development of high quality solar technologies that are adaptable to local situations. She highlighted the challenges in scaling up renewable energy technology production, including the lack of skilled workers and the need for dedicated finance.</p>
<p>Khaled Fahmy, Minister of Environment, Egypt, said that regional and national levels must be considered at the same time, focusing particularly on what unites rather than divides. He noted the need to agree on guiding principles at the regional level, saying must be built on good governance led by Africans. He said Egyptian efforts to develop a biogas industry were harmed by subsidies for fossil fuels. He emphasized that many bridges were promised in Paris, and that developing countries expect those resources will come. </p>
<p>Gérard Mestrallet, Chairman, Suez Environment, and CEO, Engie, described his company’s establishment of an internal carbon price that is integrated into the company’s investment decision-making process. He noted that including this price is “the right thing for the planet” and has already made investments in carbon uneconomical, pointing to the sale of coal plants and the rerouting of these investments to renewable energy.</p>
<p>Enrique García Rodríguez, CEO, Development Bank of Latin America, noted one challenge is whether there are even projects available to finance as there is a lack of capacity in countries to develop and prepare projects. He said that large projects are more likely to be well prepared and have access to sophisticated financial products, but that this is not the case for small projects. He said development banks can be catalytic, as they have innovative ways of measuring and reducing risk. </p>
<p>Rachel Kyte, CEO, SE4All, called for consistency in policy making in government, the private sector, the civil society and industry in order to ensure a successful transition to a low carbon economy. Calling out backroom deals that give developing country policymakers cheap fossil-fuel based energy options, she stressed the need to “turn the renewable energy narrative around,” in order to empower the public to pressure their policymakers to make clean energy choices. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, Fiji, said that a tropical cyclone has just passed over Fiji, exemplifying the consequences of climate change. He described other impacts including water scarcity and disease. He said these consequences will occur regardless of resilience and ability to cope. He called for modernizing institutional processes in order to expand capacity to address the complex challenges of climate change. He underscored that the principle challenge is accessing the finance necessary to undertake the necessary adaptation projects. </p>
<p>Highlighting food loss of up to 40% due to wasteful practices, Amira Daoud Hassan Gornass, Chair, Committee on World Food Security, called for food security policies that incorporate measures to address climate change, and described her organization’s multi-stakeholder approach to ensure that sustainable food security policies will feed more people.</p>
<p>Alfred Romuáldez, Mayor of Tacloban, the Philippines, highlighted the story of the recovery of Tacloban after its devastation by Typhoon Haiyan. He noted the city is developing a climate adaptation plan to make the city more resilient. He stressed lessons learned, including the need: for a common understanding that investment in vulnerable reduces costs later; to account for surrounding communities; to develop partnerships with the private sector; and to develop better means to disseminate information in this digital age. </p>
<p>Yolanda Kakabadse Navarro, President of World Wild Fund for Nature (WWF), called for learning from the successes of others, and working within an ecosystem approach to ensure policy coherence. She drew attention to the work of WWF in oceans, freshwater, and forests, stressing the need for multi-stakeholder collaborations including with local authorities and local communities to restore, protect and preserve ecosystems.</p>
<p>Joan Lamm-Tennant, CEO, Blue Marble Microinsurance, emphasized that small-scale insurance has provided lessons learned. She said that as an industry, insurance must be unified to become partners with development organizations. She said Blue Marble has pledged to share the innovation costs to extend insurance to the most vulnerable. </p>
<p>Representatives for youth Yugratna Srivastava, Plant-for-the-Planet, India, and Timothy Damon, SustainUS, US, made closing statements, with Srivastava stressing that empty promises will no longer be sufficient, and calling for decisions on actions that will deliver quick results. Damon underlined the need for veteran policymakers and private-sector and industry leaders to mentor and empower young people, and welcomed intergenerational cooperation to secure a just, sustainable future.</p>
<p>Drawing attention to the sense of urgency to implement the Paris Agreement and transition to low-carbon growth, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Figueres underlined that either the world becomes more resilient in the next five years, or it will be too late.</p>
<p><strong><em>CLOSING CEREMONY</em></strong></p>

TO CLIMATE CHANGE: </font></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Headline2" align="center"><b>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">14-16 JUNE 2005</font></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) seminar on the
development and transfer of environmentally sound technologies for
adaptation to climate change convened from 14-16 June 2005, at the
Hilton Hotel in Tobago, Trinidad and Tobago. The seminar was convened
following a request from the UNFCCC's Subsidiary Body for Scientific and
Technological Advice (<span class="spelle"><span style="line-height: 120%">SBSTA</span></span>)
at its twentieth session in June 2004, for the UNFCCC Secretariat to
organize a seminar on the development and transfer of environmentally
sound technologies (<span class="spelle"><span style="line-height: 120%">ESTs</span></span>)
for adaptation to climate change, in order to discuss case studies
encompassing short-, medium- and long-term examples of their
application. The terms of reference for the seminar were prepared by the
UNFCCC's Expert Group on Technology Transfer (<span class="spelle"><span style="line-height: 120%">EGTT</span></span>)
at its sixth meeting.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The
seminar provided an opportunity for different experts to exchange views
and experiences on a range of activities relating to
<span class="spelle"><span style="line-height: 120%">ESTs</span></span>
for adaptation to climate change. Topics addressed included concepts,
needs for, and identification and evaluation of, technologies for
adaptation, experiences and lessons learned and possible next steps in
developing, transferring and applying these technologies.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fifty
representatives of governments, intergovernmental and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), business and industry groups, and academic
institutions attended the workshop. Plenary sessions on Tuesday, 14
June, and Wednesday, 15 June, provided an overview of the issue of
development and transfer of ESTs for adaptation to climate change,
explored on-going activities and possible synergies, and identified
endogenous technologies for adaptation to climate change. On Wednesday
afternoon and on Thursday, 16 June, participants convened in two
parallel working groups to discuss technologies for adaptation in the
context of the UNFCCC. The meeting concluded with a roundtable debate on
ways forward.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Following the seminar's conclusion, a meeting of the EGTT was held to
consider the seminar's outcome and prepare recommendations to SBSTA.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Headline25" align="center"><b>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND ADAPTATION </font></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Climate change is considered to be one of the most serious threats to
sustainable development, with adverse impacts expected on the
environment, human health, food security, economic activity, natural
resources, and physical infrastructure. Global climate varies naturally
but scientists agree that rising concentrations of anthropogenically
produced greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere are leading to
changes in the climate. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC), the effects of climate change have already been
observed, and scientific findings indicate that precautionary and prompt
action is necessary.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The
international political response to climate change began with the
adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992. The UNFCCC sets out a framework for
action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse
gases in order to avoid "dangerous anthropogenic interference" with the
climate system. Controlled gases include methane, nitrous oxide and, in
particular, carbon dioxide. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March
1994, and now has 189 Parties. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER: </font></b><font size="2">Technology
transfer is considered a key element in combating climate change under
the UNFCCC. Technology transfer activities have been on the agenda of
every session of the SBSTA and the Conference of the Parties (COP) to
the UNFCCC. UNFCCC Article 4.5, which addresses the need for technology
transfer, states that "developed country Partiesshall take all
practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate,
the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound technologies and
know-how to other Parties, particularly developing country Parties, to
enable them to implement the provisions of the Convention," adding that
"in this process, the developed country Parties shall support the
development and enhancement of endogenous capacities and technologies of
developing country Parties."</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At COP
7, held in November 2001 in Marrakesh, Morocco, Parties decided to
establish an Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) to support the
work of the SBSTA in advancing the Convention's technology-related
goals. Since 2002, the EGTT has met several times, adopting work
programmes and providing input and advice to the SBSTA on technology
transfer. During that time, the EGTT considered a variety of issues,
focusing in particular on information dissemination, enabling
environments for the transfer of environmentally-sound technologies, and
technology needs assessments. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">ADAPTATION:</font></b><font size="2"> Adaptation is a
cross-cutting theme of the UNFCCC and is referred to in different
articles. In particular, Convention Article 4.1 states that Parties
shall "formulate, implement, publish and regularly update national and,
where appropriate, regional programmes containing measures to facilitate
adequate adaptation to climate change," and "cooperate in preparing for
adaptation to the impacts of climate change." Convention Article 4.4
states that developed country Parties shall "assist the developing
country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects
of climate change in meeting costs of adaptation to those adverse
effects." While COP 1 in 1995 addressed funding for adaptation (decision
11/CP.1), it was not until the adoption of the Marrakesh Accords in 2001
that adaptation began to be more widely seen as a prominent area for
action, as set out in decision 5/CP.7 (adverse effects of climate
change). Among other things, the decision specifically highlights the
need to support the promotion of transfer of adaptation technologies.
</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With
decision 1/CP.10 (Buenos Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and
Response Measures), Parties reached a new milestone in terms of work on
adaptation. The decision initiated a programme of work on adaptation (PWA),
emphasizing technology transfer for adaptation on an urgent basis in
priority sectors, and instructing SBSTA to develop a structured
five-year programme of work encompassing a range of technology transfer
issues. Work on this programme was initiated at SBSTA 22 in Bonn in May
2005. After an in-session workshop, numerous informal consultations and
six contact group meetings, delegates at SBSTA 22 agreed to conclusions,
which include a draft COP decision and draft annex on the SBSTA
programme. However, SBSTA 22 did not finalize the programme, and the
draft decision and annex remain bracketed. The work programme will be
further considered by SBSTA 23 in November/December 2005.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Headline25" align="center"><b>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">REPORT OF THE SEMINAR</font></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Earl
Nesbitt, Trinidad and Tobago's Minister of Public Utilities and the
Environment, opened the meeting on Tuesday, 14 June, and chaired the
morning session. He drew attention to climate change and ESTs for
adaptation in the context of sustainable development. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">EGTT
Chair Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) outlined the development
of UNFCCC work on technology transfer and adaptation. He noted that
identifying and implementing technologies for adaptation will involve
methodologies such as vulnerability assessment and technical needs
assessment (TNAs). </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">SBSTA
Chair Abdullatif Salem Benrageb (Libya) emphasized the importance of
adaptation and technologies for adaptation, in addition to the need for
immediate action to mitigate climate change. He said that the seminar's
outcome will be considered by the EGTT and reviewed by SBSTA. He hoped
the seminar would generate practical ideas that the EGTT could take up
in its programme of work, including identifying next steps in
developing, transferring, and applying technologies. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Janos
Pasztor, UNFCCC Secretariat, said adaptation has always been a priority
for developing countries. He said the seminar represents the first time
a group is undertaking substantive work on adaptation. Pasztor said the
EGTT would follow up on the meeting by producing technical papers and
practical information, as well as selecting key ideas and turning them
into concrete recommendations for the SBSTA and the COP. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Orville London, Chief Secretary of the Tobago House of Assembly,
recognized the critical importance of the seminar in assisting decision
makers in fostering sustainable development. Underlining Trinidad and
Tobago's vulnerability to floods and hurricanes, he stressed that his
country and region have finally concluded that actions must be taken to
mitigate climate change and to cope with disasters. He highlighted the
need to enhance the synergies between financial resources and technical
expertise in order to address climate change. He urged participants to
reach recommendations for policy-making processes especially regarding
floods, water resources and agricultural activities, and said the
success of this seminar will depend on developing ways to disseminate
its outcomes among as many decision makers as possible. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Penelope Beckles, Trinidad and Tobago's Minister of Public Utilities and
the Environment, stressed that small island developing States (SIDS)
have already been suffering the negative impacts of climate change due
to their geographical location, lack of technical and financial
resources, and the vulnerability of their biodiversity to climate
change. She expressed hope that the experiences shared in the seminar
would further prepare participants to cope with disasters and adapt to
climate change. Beckles noted climate changes that impose serious
challenges in achieving sustainable development objectives are being
detected in Tobago, such as: changes in the duration of seasons; loss of
agricultural land; and changes in water availability. Noting the need to
increase the research on technology for adaptation, Beckles highlighted
the importance of promoting technology transfer within the UNFCCC
process. She welcomed activities on the ground that transfer technology
to developing countries. Beckles acknowledged the importance of
partnerships to promote sustainable development in SIDS, and noted some
activities carried out by her country to mitigate greenhouse gas
emissions, including: increasing forest cover; using alternative fuel
and new technology with lower greenhouse gas emissions; and moving
towards cleaner production technology and energy efficiency practices.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Headline3" align="justify"><b><i>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">SETTING THE SCENE</font></i></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Following the seminar's opening on Tuesday morning, participants heard
overview presentations and discussed expectations for the seminar. The
session was chaired by Kishan Kumarsingh. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT:</font></b><font size="2"> Wanna
Tanunchaiwatana, UNFCCC Secretariat, presented the background and
context for the seminar. She noted that adaptation is a cross-cutting
activity under the UNFCCC, and is being addressed by the Subsidiary Body
for Implementation (SBI) as well as by SBSTA. She noted that COP 10
requested SBSTA to develop a five-year structured programme of work on
scientific and technical and socioeconomic aspects of the impacts of,
and vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change (referred to as the
PWA). She asked delegates to consider: what practical next steps would
be to promote the development and transfer of ESTs for adaptation to
climate change; what possible contributions this seminar could make for
the development of the PWA; how the PWA could support the work of the
EGTT; and what the seminar's key message to the SBSTA should be. </font>
</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Florin
Vladu, UNFCCC Secretariat, gave an overview of technologies for
adaptation to climate change in the UNFCCC process. He said that
defining adaptation technologies in the context of climate change is
difficult, and suggested that an operational definition might be "the
application of technology in order to reduce the vulnerability, or
enhance the resilience, of a natural or human system to the impacts of
climate change." Vladu noted that technological approaches to adaptation
include both "hard" technologies such as capital goods and hardware, as
well as "soft" technologies such as knowledge of methods and techniques,
which enable "hard" technologies to be applied. Stressing that the
benefits might be too far in the future and local uncertainties too
numerous to justify large investments solely for climate change, he
suggested that investments should begin with present-day needs that are
further justified by consideration of climate change. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Richard Klein, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Germany,
and UNFCCC consultant, presented the seminar background paper on
applications of ESTs for adaptation to climate change. He noted that the
paper provides an overview of concepts, challenges, experiences and
lessons learned in developing, transferring and applying ESTs for
adaptation. He highlighted some issues outlined in the draft paper,
including: concepts and definitions of adaptation to climate change;
implications for developing and transferring technology; and policy
issues. Klein noted that adaptation measures include: increasing
robustness of infrastructural designs and long-term investments;
increasing flexibility of vulnerable managed systems; enhancing
adaptability of vulnerable natural systems; reversing trends that
increase vulnerability; and improving societal awareness and
preparedness. Klein stressed the importance of adaptation, noting that:
climate change cannot be totally avoided; anticipatory adaptation
(adjustments prior to the manifestation of impacts based on the
expectation of changes) is more effective and less costly than emergency
measures; climate change may be more rapid and pronounced than currently
suggested; and immediate benefits can be gained from better adaptation
to climate variability and extreme events. He highlighted that
adaptation processes should include: raising awareness; planning design,
policy criteria and development objectives; implementing activities; and
monitoring outcomes. Klein underscored some factors that determine
adaptive capacity of human systems, including the level of economic
wealth, access to technology, information, knowledge and skills, and
existence of institutions, infrastructure and social capital.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">SEMINAR EXPECTATIONS:</font></b><font size="2"> A number
of participants presented comments and inputs regarding seminar
expectations. Canada stressed the importance of institutional changes
for successful implementation of adaptation technologies. She hoped for
a wide discussion on technology and adaptation measures, impacts that
technology changes may have in communities, and successful applications
of adaptation technologies. Barbados expected participants to discuss
the importance of financial resources for transferring adaptation
technology and ways to strengthen institutions and promote cooperation
among developing countries. Ghana said its expectations focused on
identifying technologies that can promote climate change mitigation and
adaptation activities. Japan urged discussion on improving TNAs,
exchanging and disseminating information on existing technologies for
adaptation measures, and mainstreaming adaptation and sustainable
development policies at national levels. Noting that his country faces
numerous challenges for adaptation to climate change, China highlighted
the need for coordinating the design and implementation of measures to
promote technology transfer, which could include defining concepts,
raising information awareness, enhancing early warning systems and
models, building human capacity, and identifying priorities for
adaptation.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
<font size="2">Discussion:</font></b><font size="2"> Several developing
countries highlighted the need for: focusing on the means to transfer
technology from developed countries to developing countries; providing
concrete examples of transferring adaptation technology; promoting
stakeholder participation; and defining technological needs for
adaptation in national assessments. Several developed countries
underscored the importance of: assessing practical next steps to promote
technology transfer; analyzing the means for disseminating useful and
available technology information to countries that need technologies;
exploring synergies between adaptation and mitigation technologies; and
enhancing the capacity of countries that need technologies.</font></font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One
participant underscored the need to establish ways to communicate the
implementation of adaptation measures and risk reduction to insurance
companies in order to see these actions reflected in insurance premiums
and conditions. A participant expressed concern about ways to capture
and apply indigenous knowledge regarding adaptation measures. </font>

straightforward, TNA for adaptation is more complex and challenging. He
identified several issues in the identification of technology needs for
adaptation, including: </font></font></p>

presented a preliminary analysis of 14 TNA reports. Noting that most
countries adopted a sectoral approach for TNAs, he outlined criteria for
prioritization of options and the share of adaptation and mitigation
options by sector. He said that lessons learned from this process
include: development is the biggest priority for countries; capacity
building and government and stakeholder involvement are important;
cross-sectoral issues should be addressed, including linkages between
mitigation and adaptation priorities; and cost is one of the highest
barriers in technology transfer.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Mahendra Kumar, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), presented
experiences and lessons learned from TNAs conducted by UNEP. He
presented the adaptation and mitigation technology needs examined by
sector, noting that for some sectors (e.g., energy) almost all countries
looked at both adaptation and mitigation, while for others (e.g.,
coastal zones) countries looked only at adaptation. He outlined the
needed technologies, criteria for technology selection, and barriers to
adaptation identified by TNAs for various sectors: coastal zones,
energy, forestry and land use, industry, transport, waste management,
and water resources. He said many countries identified tools, such as
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and tide gauges, rather than
technologies, and noted the need to more clearly define adaptation
technology. He stressed the need to increase capacity, particularly in
the area of science and technology, and to strengthen linkages to

measures and facilitate adaptation. She noted that the programme
includes vulnerability analysis, and a summary of identified adaptation
measures for agriculture, biodiversity, coastal resources, water
resources, fishery resources, and human health. Sena underscored the
programme also includes cross-sectoral measures oriented to:
institutional strengthening on climate change matters; development of a

Anthony Nyong, University of Jos, Nigeria, presented results from a
vulnerability project in the West African Sahel. He said the main
vulnerabilities of the population in this region stem from either water
or agriculture issues. Noting that climate variability, rather than
climate change, is an ever-present regional concern, he said that coping
with present-day variability would go a long way down the road towards
adapting for climate change. On adaptation, he pointed out that
households have been implementing different adaptation technologies for
many years, and that many decisions on adaptation are taken at the
community level through farm associations. Using participant-identified
indicators of success, he said that water harvesting technology is one
of the most desired technologies. Nyong concluded that local knowledge
is a major underutilized resource in adaptation, and that development
efforts should be applied with an understanding of, and sensitivity to,
local communities. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Richard Klein spoke on technology for adaptation to climate change in
coastal zones. He noted that coastal zones are among the environments
under most stress, yet offer significant opportunities for economic
development. He observed that first-order effects of climate change on
coastal zones include: sea-level rise; increases in seawater
temperature; increased precipitation intensity; changes in wave climate,
storm frequency, and river runoff; and increased ecosystem productivity
due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Focusing on sea-level
rise, Klein noted that the number of impacts assessed in vulnerability
studies is very limited. He observed that even stringent mitigation
measures would have limited impacts on the number of people at risk from
floods, because of lag times in the atmosphere and ocean systems. Klein
noted the existence of several tools and strategies for information,
planning and implementation, and said there is a need for consultation
and coordination with stakeholders in coastal zone management. </font>

Francis Agyemang-Yeboah, School of Medical Science, Ghana, noted the
distribution and abundance of disease vector organisms and intermediate
hosts are affected by changes in both physical and biological factors in
the ecosystem. He presented a case study from Ghana combining air
temperature and humidity projections with distribution of diseases. He
concluded that periods of high meningitis, diarrhea and malaria cases
coincide with periods of high maximum air temperature. Agyemang-Yeboah
said the socioeconomic impacts of such diseases include reduced income
of affected individuals due to loss of productivity. He suggested some
health adaptation strategies and identified technologies for preventing
and curing diseases. For malaria, Agyemang-Yeboah suggested the
development of vaccines, herbal preparations, insecticide, impregnated
nets and combined therapy. For cerebrospinal meningitis, he suggested
altered house designs, early vaccination initiatives, mobile clinics and
health education. For cholera, he suggested the use of bole-hole drills
for capturing water, the employment of activated charcoal domestic water
filtration systems, and the establishment of locations for disease
screening and medical care. For coping with climate change and health
issues, Agyemang-Yeboah underscored the need for socioeconomic
adaptation, capacity-building initiatives, coordinated health policies,
evaluation and monitoring, strong institutions, cost-effective
technologies, and financial resources. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ian
Burton, Independent Consultant, Canada, stressed the importance of
motivating individuals to spread adaptation technology, especially
related to extreme events. He noted that with regard to infrastructure
and adaptation requirements, developers have an apparent preference for
more exposed or dangerous locations, which can have particular economic
benefits. For coping with extreme climate events, Burton suggested:
revision of civil construction codes and standards taking into account
weather extremes; raising stakeholders' awareness of climate change
impacts; providing advice on ways to incorporate climate change into
stakeholders' decision-making processes; developing insurance products
through the private insurance industry; and lowering insurance premiums
for areas where adaptation measures have been implemented. </font></p>

Abhayasingha Bandara, Sri Lanka's Department of Meteorology, addressed
the issue of adaptation to increased thunderstorm hazards among
low-income families. Noting a variety of lightning risks to human lives
and concrete constructions, he said providing "earth terminal"
installations is necessary for avoiding accidents and damages. Bandara
stressed that in his country the practice of building houses with
aluminum roofs on mountaintops and without earth terminals attracts 
lightning, causing losses of human lives and damage to properties. He
suggested that precautionary steps be considered during construction,
such as low-cost lightning rod technologies. </font></p>

drought. In response to a question on the role of policies, Nyong
clarified that he had assessed the impact of both national and
state-level policies on adaptation in the region. </font></font></p>

climate change and human health, one participant underlined the linkages
between water system storage and diseases. Another suggested analyzing
the connections between malnutrition and the spread of diseases in the
Ghana case study. Agyemang-Yeboah said that there is need for adaptive
responses for malnutrition related to climate change, such as that
caused by drought and loss of agricultural land. One participant
highlighted the need for technology to identify and prevent the spread
of diseases at an early stage, and Agyemang-Yeboah agreed these
technologies would be useful.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On
insurance, a participant raised the issue of reinsurance, and Burton
clarified that reinsurance companies are currently addressing the
question of catastrophic losses. Another participant noted the need for
public sector involvement, particularly in areas of extreme high risk. A
participant noted that insured parties should be partners in reducing
risk. Pasztor pointed out that two workshops on insurance have been
conducted under the Convention. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Responding to a question of whether climate change is a quantifiable
risk factor, Burton clarified that though it is not precisely
quantifiable, it could be taken into account in decision-making using
expert judgment. One participant noted that strategic partnerships with
professional organizations could be useful, and another said that
focusing on property losses ignores more significant human losses in
developing countries. Burton agreed, but noted that human losses in
disasters are decreasing as a result of better early warning and

Daniele Violetti, UNFCCC Secretariat, presented an overview of trends in
financial flows and ongoing work on innovative financing for the
development and transfer of technology. On funding targeted to climate
change, he noted that funding is available from: bilateral activities of
Parties; multilateral activities such as the GEF, the World Bank or
regional banks; the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF); the LDC Fund (LDCF);
financial flows generated by Joint Implementation/Clean Development
Mechanism projects; and private sector investments. He surveyed funding
flows outside the Convention, noting the increasing role of the private
sector in funding provision. Violetti pointed out that a workshop on
innovative financing was held in Montreal from 25-27 September 2004, and
summarized its conclusions in the areas of TNAs, toolkits and handbooks,
training and capacity building, enabling environments, risk management,
dialogue, the role of financing, and adaptation. He noted that a

Bonizella Biagini, GEF, presented financing provisions for adaptation
technologies under the Convention. She outlined the role of the GEF in
providing financing, and gave an overview of funds available for
adaptation activities. For implementation activities, she noted that
four programmes are available: the Strategic Priority on Adaptation
(SPA) trust fund; the LDCF; the SCCF; and the Adaptation Fund under the
Kyoto Protocol. Noting that the SPA projects are designed to "show how
adaptation planning and assessment can be practically translated into
projects that will provide real benefits," she summarized SPA projects
in process in Kiribati, Colombia, the Caribbean, and Africa. She
clarified that while the SPA funds the incremental costs of projects
that have global benefits, LCDF and SCCF fund the additional cost of
adaptation measures that are not required to include global benefits.
While the LCDF funds projects for LDCs' urgent and immediate needs as
identified in NAPAs, SCCF funds projects in priority areas of
intervention with a longer-term approach and strategy. She noted that
the top priority area of the SCCF is adaptation, and that its second
priority area is technology transfer.</font></p>

at both innovative and conventional financing opportunities, and that
capacity-building activities are needed for Parties to understand the
functions of financing and ways to apply them. One participant
underscored the need for financial resources that could be used for
private technologies. Several participants asked how the GEF defines and
measures "global benefits." Biagini answered that a full definition of

Biological Diversity (CBD), summarized the CBD objectives: conservation
of biodiversity; sustainable use of its components; and fair and
equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of
genetic resources. He noted that CBD Parties are to provide and
facilitate access to and transfer of technologies that are relevant to
the CBD objectives. Lehmann stressed that, under the CBD, access to
genetic resources can be granted in exchange for access to, and transfer
of, technology that makes use of those genetic resources. He stressed
that transfer of technology in the CBD includes technology protected by
intellectual property rights and must be implemented in accordance with
international law. He noted the CBD programme of work includes elements
related to technology assessments, information systems, enabling
environments and capacity building. Lehmann noted that sets of
technology for both biodiversity and climate change are difficult to
define, and said there are opportunities for sharing experiences and
good practices and cooperating to minimize trade-offs. </font></font>

Noble, World Bank, said the World Bank is concerned about climate change
because the poor will face the greatest challenges from its

countries were affected by climate-related disasters in the 1990s, and
2% of World Bank funds are diverted to disaster relief. Noble said that
while climate change is a very minor factor in the Bank's development
decision-making processes, it is becoming more relevant to project
planning, and climate variability is already a major impediment to
development. Noble noted that funds for mitigation and adaptation under
climate change are limited and must be used effectively. He presented a
screening tool under development by the World Bank that allows anyone to
view models and find out whether a specific project will need to take
into account climate change factors.</font></p>

storage. On wetlands, he mentioned a floating agriculture technique
called <i>baira</i>, traditionally practiced in southern districts but
recently introduced in other wetland areas through environment and
development projects. He enumerated coping strategies, such as
polyculture, rainwater harvesting, migration, and afforestation. He said
a main lesson was that endogenous technology for adaptation is

studies on adaptation technologies. A participant underscored that
identifying existing technologies and adjusting them to the country
level should be considered before transferring technology. Participants
highlighted the need to: promote more south-south cooperation and more
discussion on adaptation technologies and practices; link technologies
for adaptation with development goals; and hold further discussion on
the practical exchange of information including maladaptation issues.</font></p>

financing experts to participate in the next seminar in order to
identify financing prospects. Participants also highlighted the need to:
identify innovative financing packages to facilitate the transfer of
adaptation technologies; engage the insurance industry in adaptation
discussions; and identify specific private sector stakeholders to be
involved. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">
What synergies within the Convention and other MEAs might be pursued to
enhance the work on technologies for adaptation?</font></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">WG-I
participants noted the need to take advantage of synergies, and
mentioned in particular the need to coordinate the work of the expert
groups. Participants also noted possibilities for coordination with the
GEF, CBD, the TRIPS agreement, and the International Monetary Fund.
Though some participants underscored the need to coordinate strategies
for adaptation and mitigation, one participant noted that the two are
separate issues and did not want to see synergies in this area.</font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">WG-II
participants recognized that the ongoing cooperation and information
sharing between expert groups established under the Convention has
proven to be very useful and should continue. Several participants also
suggested inviting representatives from other conventions, such as the
UN Convention to Combat Desertification and the CBD to take part in
adaptation discussions. A participant suggested identifying specific
fields in which synergies can be enhanced. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">
SBSTA is developing a five-year structured programme of work built
around the following issues: methodologies, data and modeling;
vulnerability assessments; adaptation planning, measures and actions;
and integration into sustainable development. Given these four themes,
what messages coming from this seminar would you deem important that
might be considered for inclusion in this programme of work on
adaptation?</font></b></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">WG-I
participants noted that research and development on technologies for
adaptation should be noted in the PWA. Another noted the need for
synergies between mitigation and adaptation, while another said that
coordination rather than synergies were important. Some cautioned that
the PWA should take advantage of work done already and not develop a
completely parallel process. </font></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">WG-II
participants suggested: ensuring that efforts aimed at addressing
technologies for adaptation contributes to meet sustainable development
objectives; promoting awareness-raising and information-sharing
initiatives; and integrating adaptation and mitigation activities.</font><span class="ENB-Headline3Char"></span></p>

<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Moussa
Sanon, Department of Management of Natural Resources, Burkina Faso,
presented a case study on transfer of technology and capacity building
for coping with climate variability. He noted that experts focused their
work on cotton and cattle ranching, carried out guided discussions with
stakeholders, and highlighted the importance of: restoring and improving
soil fertility; increasing collection of rainwater; strengthening
capacities with field demonstrations; and improving irrigation
efficiency. Sanon said the case study launched a workshop to foster
effective stakeholder participation, information-sharing and
awareness-raising. He concluded that successful technology transfer
projects need to: involve stakeholders from the beginning of a project;
elaborate inventories on techniques and constraints; apply a variety of
technologies rather than isolated ones; and strengthen capacities.</font></p>

Tanunchaiwatana said the seminar will contribute to the EGTT task of
preparing a report on adaptation for SBSTA's consideration by the
twenty-third sessions of the subsidiary bodies (SB 23). </font></p>

Chair Benrageb commended participants for their hard work and commitment
during the seminar and thanked the government of Trinidad and Tobago and
the UNFCCC Secretariat. He highlighted that the seminar provided useful
ideas for the elaboration of SBSTA work on adaptation issues. He noted
some challenges ahead, including: defining global benefits; sharing more
experiences; exploring innovative finance to complement existing
financial mechanisms under the Convention; increasing partnerships with
the private sector; enhancing synergies with other MEAs; fostering
capacity building; and combining adaptation with mitigation activities.

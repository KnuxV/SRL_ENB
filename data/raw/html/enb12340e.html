ON ADAPTATION PLANNING AND PRACTICES UNDER THE NAIROBI WORK
PROGRAMME: <br>

10-12 SEPTEMBER 2007</span></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
The
<a target="_blank" href="/climate/cawro/" style="text-decoration: none">UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Workshop on
Adaptation Planning and Practices under the Nairobi Work Programme
on Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change (NWP)</a> was
held from 10-12 September 2007, at FAO headquarters in Rome, Italy.
The workshop focused on adaptation planning and practices, one of
the nine areas of work under the NWP. Approximately 150 participants
were in attendance, representing governments, UN agencies and
constituted bodies, academia, non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
and those contributing as experts. The workshop aimed to identify
action pledges from organizations to fill capacity gaps and address
challenges in adaptation planning and practice. The workshop
concluded with a number of recommendations for adaptation planning
and practices, and action pledges from several organizations. The
<a href="#REPORT%20OF%20THE%20WORKSHOP" style="text-decoration: none">report of the workshop</a> will be forwarded to SBSTA 28, scheduled for
June 2008.</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Adaptation planning and practices are important for governments,
regional authorities and communities who must plan and decide on how
best to reduce their vulnerability to climate change, and how
adaptation can be implemented in the most effective manner. The
objectives of this area of work under the NWP are to collect,
analyze and disseminate information on past and current practical
adaptation actions and measures, including projects, short- and
long-term strategies, and local and indigenous knowledge, and to
facilitate communication and cooperation among and between parties
and relevant organizations, business, civil society, decision makers
and other stakeholders. This can be done through: exchanging
information on experiences, lessons learned, constraints and
barriers; promoting different ways and means for information sharing
and for the enhancement of cooperation among parties and relevant
sectors, institutions and communities; promoting understanding of
response strategies, including early warning systems and local
coping strategies; and assessing ways and means to support
adaptation. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Ongoing activities under this area of work include workshops,
mandated submissions, action pledges, dissemination of good
practices, and identification of activities that will help fill
knowledge gaps. </p>

<span style="text-transform:none; font-weight:700">A BRIEF HISTORY OF ADAPTATION TO
CLIMATE CHANGE UNDER THE UNFCCC</span></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Climate change is considered to be one of the most serious threats
to current and future sustainable development, with adverse impacts
already observed on the environment, human health, food security,
economic activity, natural resources and physical infrastructure.
The international political response to climate change began with
the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992 focusing on controlling and
responding to the changes in climate. Thus, the UNFCCC sets out a
framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations
of greenhouse gases to avoid “dangerous anthropogenic interference”
with the climate system. Along with mitigation of greenhouse gases,
the UNFCCC also supports countries’ efforts to adapt to the impacts
of climate change, through capacity building, technology transfer
and funding to support adaptation assessments and projects. The
UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, and now has 191 parties,
who convene annually in a Conference of the Parties (COP), and twice
a year in meetings of the subsidiary bodies – the Subsidiary Body
for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and
Technological Advice (SBSTA). COP 13 will be held in Bali,
Indonesia, from 3-14 December 2007. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<b>MITIGATION: </b>In December 1997, delegates at COP 3 in Kyoto,
Japan, agreed to the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits
developed countries and countries making the transition to a market
economy to achieve quantified reduction targets for their greenhouse
gas emissions. These countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I
parties, agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse
gases by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels between 2008-2012 (the
first commitment period), with specific targets varying from country
to country. The Protocol also establishes three flexible mechanisms
to assist Annex I parties in meeting their national targets: an
emissions trading system; joint implementation of
emissions-reduction projects between Annex I parties; and the Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM), which allows for projects to be
implemented in non-Annex I parties. To date, there are 175 parties
to the Kyoto Protocol, including 37 Annex I parties representing
61.6% of 1990 Annex I greenhouse gas emissions. The Protocol entered
into force on 16 February 2005. The third Meeting of the Parties
will be held in conjunction with COP 13. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<b>ADAPTATION:</b> Unlike mitigation of greenhouse gases, adaptation
to the impacts of climate change is a cross-cutting theme under the
UNFCCC. In particular, Convention Article 4.1 states that parties
shall “formulate, implement, publish and regularly update national
and, where appropriate, regional programmes containing measures
to…facilitate adequate adaptation to climate change,” and “cooperate
in preparing for adaptation to the impacts of climate change.”
Convention Article 4.4 states that developed country parties shall
“assist the developing country parties that are particularly
vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in meeting the
costs of adaptation to those adverse effects.” One of the most significant articles for adaptation is Convention Article 4.8, which says that "parties shall give full consideration to what actions are necessary under the Convention...to meet the specific needs and concerns of developing country parties arising from the adverse effects of climate change." Negotiations under this article laid the groundwork for discussions on adaptation in the UNFCCC.
While COP 1 in 1995
addressed funding for adaptation (decision 11/CP.1), it was not
until the adoption of the Marrakesh Accords in 2001 that adaptation
became a prominent area for action, as set out in decision 5/CP.7
(adverse effects of climate change).</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Following consideration of the Third Assessment Report of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), parties initiated
a discussion on adaptation at COP 9 in December 2003. At that time,
the COP requested the SBSTA to work on scientific, technical and
socioeconomic aspects of, and vulnerability and adaptation to,
climate change (decision 10/CP.9). </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Parties reached a milestone in 2004 at COP 10 with decision 1/CP.10,
known as the Buenos Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and
Response Measures. The programme of work was later elaborated on at
a workshop in Bonn in October 2005. COP 10 set up two complimentary
tracks for adaptation: the development of a structured five-year
programme of work on the scientific, technical and socioeconomic
aspects of vulnerability and adaptation to climate change under
SBSTA, which was adopted at COP 11 (decision 2/CP.11); and the
improvement of information and methodologies, implementation of
concrete adaptation activities, technology transfer and capacity
building under the SBI. As part of the latter, the COP requested
three regional workshops and one expert meeting for small island
developing states (SIDS) to facilitate information exchange and
integrated assessments to assist in identifying specific adaptation
needs and concerns, all of which have been held.</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<b>NAIROBI WORK PROGRAMME: </b>In November 2006, COP 12 renamed the
SBSTA five-year work programme the Nairobi Work Programme on
Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change (NWP). The
work programme aims to assist countries, in particular developing
countries, including the least developed countries (LDCs) and SIDS,
to improve their understanding and assessment of impacts,
vulnerability and adaptation, and assist countries in making
informed decisions on practical adaptation actions and measures to
respond to climate change on a sound, scientific, technical and
socioeconomic basis, taking into account current and future climate
change and variability. To achieve these aims, the NWP has nine
areas of work: methods and tools; data and observations; climate
modeling, scenarios and downscaling; climate-related risks and
extreme events; socioeconomic information; adaptation planning and
practices; research; technologies for adaptation; and economic
diversification.</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
The expected outcomes of the NWP are: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">enhanced capacity at international, regional, national, sectoral and
local levels to further identify and understand impacts,
vulnerability, and adaptation responses, and to select and implement
practical, effective and high-priority adaptation actions; </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">improved information and advice to the COP and its subsidiary bodies
on the scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of impacts,
vulnerability and adaptation; </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">enhanced development, dissemination and use of knowledge from
practical adaptation activities;</p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">enhanced cooperation among all actors, aimed at enhancing their
ability to manage climate change risks; and </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">enhanced integration adaptation to climate change with sustainable
development efforts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
The workshop on adaptation planning and practices is the second
event focused on the nine areas of work. A workshop on
climate-related risks and extreme events was held on 18-20 June 2007
in Cairo, Egypt. Other planned events include an expert meeting on
methods and tools, to be held in parallel with a meeting on data and
observations, and a meeting on socioeconomic information. An
in-session workshop on climate modeling, scenarios and downscaling
will be held at SBSTA 28 (June 2008). In addition, synthesis reports
are being prepared on research, technology for adaptation, and
economic diversification. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
SBSTA 28 is expected to consider further activities, as well as
appropriate timing and modalities for their inclusion in the
programme of work based on the results of the initial activities,
information presented in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, and
other new scientific information, as well as relevant activities
from international and regional institutions. SBSTA will review and
report on the programme of work to COP 16 in December 2010.</p>

<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
SBSTA Chair Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) opened the
workshop on Monday, 10 September 2007. Welcoming participants,
Kumarsingh noted that the NWP defines the regional needs and
priorities for adaptation activities under consideration by the
UNFCCC. He highlighted climate change risks facing developing
countries and the importance of assisting the NWP in information
dissemination and the promotion of monitoring and technical
practices for adaptation activities.</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Roberto Acosta, Coordinator of the Adaptation, Technology and
Science Programme, UNFCCC Secretariat, observed that adaptation has
become increasingly important. He stressed the significance of the
NWP workshops for enabling developing countries to make more
informed decisions.</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Alexander Müller, Natural Resources Management and Environment
Department, FAO, highlighted climate change links with agriculture,
forestry and fisheries. He emphasized that agriculture contributes
to climate change through land-use change, deforestation, livestock
production and greenhouse gas emissions. He observed, however, that
appropriate natural resource management practices and biofuels used
under certain conditions can enhance mitigation. Turning to food
security, he pointed out that climate change impacts will shift
regional focus to sub-Saharan Africa, in the context of food
availability, access, stability and utilization. Müller emphasized
the need to “climate proof” development strategies and for
adaptation efforts to focus on education, good governance, human
resource development, institutional capacity building, better
resource management, and the transfer of appropriate technologies.
</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
During the three-day workshop, participants met in three plenary
sessions and two sets of four break-out groups, which focused on
<a href="#SESSION%202:%20ADAPTATION%20PLANNING%20AND%20PRACTICES%20IN%20DIFFERENT%20SECTORS%20AND%20CONTRIBUTION%20OF%20TRADITIONAL%20KNOWLEDGE" style="text-decoration: none">adaptation planning and practices in different sectors and

practices across different levels and sectors</a>. Each set of break-out
groups reported back to plenary on their deliberations and
recommendations. On Wednesday afternoon, participants met in plenary
in a roundtable session, during which organizations made pledges of
actions to support the implementation of the NWP.</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
To prepare for the workshop, SBSTA invited parties and relevant
organizations to provide structured submissions on adaptation
approaches, strategies, practices and technologies for adaptation at
the regional, national and local levels in different sectors, as
well as on experiences, needs and concerns. Throughout the three
days, the UNFCCC Secretariat requested participants to fill out
questionnaires on key actions that have the greatest potential to
help parties adapt to climate change, which will be compiled by the
Secretariat.</p>

<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Roberto Acosta said the IPCC assessment reports have been important
for raising the profile of adaptation by describing future climate
change impacts. He described the institutional framework under the
UNFCCC to support adaptation, including funds and Convention expert
groups, including the LDC Expert Group (LEG), the Consultative Group
of Experts on non-Annex I national communications (CGE) and the
Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT). Acosta noted that
parties have agreed that adaptation is one of the key building
blocks for post-2012 arrangements under the UNFCCC, as evidenced by
the outcomes of the Vienna Climate Change Talks from 27-31 August
2007. He said the NWP can provide the necessary scientific basis to
support increased efforts on adaptation.</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Olga Pilifosova, UNFCCC Secretariat, gave a brief overview of the
NWP. She explained the importance of such high-profile workshops,
highlighting that the outcomes are intended to identify adaptation
activities and gaps and catalyze actions. She pointed to inputs for
the workshop, including: submissions from parties and organizations;
outputs from UN constituted bodies; outputs from activities in other
NWP focus areas; and information on other UNFCCC adaptation
activities. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
María Gutiérrez, UNFCCC Secretariat, outlined submissions on
adaptation planning and practices, noting that they mostly reflect
that activities are in the early stages of implementation. Gutíerrez
said approximately half the submissions identify national adaptation
plans or frameworks, mainly focused on flood and drought management.
She observed that needs and concerns are relatively consistent among
different actors, including capacity-building and budget needs,
encouraging political buy-in, engaging stakeholders, coordination,
spatial and temporal scaling issues, and lack of flexibility in
available funds. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Annett Möhner, UNFCCC Secretariat, described relevant activities and
outputs of the LEG, CGE, and EGTT. She pointed to the LEG database
on local coping strategies and the EGTT practitioners’ guide on
preparing technology projects for financing. She said the groups
have identified two categories of barriers: financial constraints;
and lack of scientific and technical capacities. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Jeff Tschirley, FAO, discussed building on past lessons and
experiences, filling gaps and overcoming constraints, and exploiting
opportunities for action. He stressed the need to act holistically
across key sectors and for economic diversification. Regarding
climate change’s implications for agriculture, he said global
agricultural production is likely to increase, but not in the most
vulnerable areas, and emphasized the importance of improved water
storage and more efficient water use. He stressed developing
flexible national adaptation plans as different responses may be
required over time. Regarding food security, he said supply, access,
availability and quality must be sustained in the context of climate
change. He stressed linking adaptation actions to mitigation,
disaster risk reduction, emergency responses and development
assistance initiatives. Regarding gaps and constraints, he mentioned
lack of experience in successfully integrating adaptation and
mitigation. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Regarding opportunities for action, Tschirley stressed linking
adaptation and policy frameworks, identifying vulnerable populations
and ecosystems, maintaining the viability of economically important
activities, transboundary collaborative mechanisms, and bioenergy.
He urged merging policy and regulatory frameworks with activities at
the local level. In conclusion, he said adaptation has its place
within a post-2012 agreement, noting that the NWP is not the only
approach to adaptation, but rather an intermediate step. </p>

</a>SESSION 2: ADAPTATION PLANNING AND PRACTICES IN DIFFERENT SECTORS AND
CONTRIBUTION OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE</span></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Four sectoral break-out groups were held under this session, on:
agriculture and food security; water resources; coastal zones
(settlements, ecosystems and infrastructure); and health. In plenary
on Monday afternoon, break-out group facilitators briefly
highlighted key questions and issues for discussion in their
respective groups. Participants then broke into the four groups that
met through Tuesday morning. Discussions were structured around
stocktaking, barriers and constraints, and possible further actions
with respect to adaptation planning and practices in the sectors. On
Tuesday afternoon, facilitators presented discussion outcomes and
recommendations to plenary. The discussions, outcomes and
recommendations are summarized below. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<b>AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY: </b>This group was facilitated by
Habiba Gitay, World Bank Institute, and Ian Burton, independent
consultant. Participants addressed the prevailing situation in the
context of adaptation and shared lessons learned and country
experiences. They discussed the inadequacy of rural agricultural
extension services and the lack of respect for local knowledge,
linked with a typical top-down approach. One participant informed
that India has implemented policies that reduce risks and enhance
adaptive capacity, as well as implementing a food distribution
strategy, which entails maintaining a buffer stock of crops to be
distributed during droughts and floods. Another participant
described a district in Kenya where climate data is downscaled to
provide information for timing fertilization and watering.
Participants also discussed educating farmers to use climate
information to design coping strategies and the possible conflict
between indigenous knowledge and scientific climate information. The
issue of deteriorating meteorological data, particularly in
developing countries, was also raised. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
On barriers and constraints, participants stressed the absence of
dialogue between government officials and local communities, where
local information is gathered for national purposes, but is not
necessarily fed back to local communities. Participants also
identified: the difficulty in changing entrenched agricultural
practices; knowledge of adaptation at the local level being
contingent on understanding the science of climate change,
especially for extension services and farmer organizations; the
interface between pastoralists and sedentary farmers in the context
of land-use change; and adapting agribusiness to climate change. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Four subgroups then discussed: developing functional institutions;
national strategies for mitigation and adaptation; creating an
alternative agricultural paradigm; and developing relevant expertise
to meet the adaptation challenge. On functional institutions, the
group identified the need for an appropriate legal framework,
continuous empowerment at various levels, public-private
partnerships and building capacity for cross-sectoral communication
and information sharing. The group also suggested: raising awareness
at various levels; an institutional framework, which incorporates
both a top-down and bottom-up approach; and implementation of
strategies and programmes concerning scientific and research
programmes on adaptation. Participants identified ensuring the
commitment of key stakeholders as a major challenge in relation to
incorporating climate change into a relevant policy framework in the
areas of energy, agriculture and food security. The possibility of
using a cost-benefit analysis was also mooted as a buy-in strategy.

On the issue of rethinking the current agricultural model, the group
reported that the current agricultural system undervalues local
knowledge of biodiversity and decreases the resilience of smallholder
farmers. Payment for ecosystem services was raised and the relevance
of traditional knowledge affirmed. The characteristics of a new
paradigm include: shifting local and regional food systems to use
the most appropriate knowledge; engaging with big business and other
stakeholders; and moving from a current emphasis on short-term
profits to long-term benefits. On modalities for building capacity,
the group suggested that farmers would benefit from technical
capacity development to enable them to shift to more appropriate
farming methods. The group emphasized that organizations that
support farmers also need to understand the science of climate
change. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Participants also discussed overcoming behavioral inertia and
resistance to adopting climate change knowledge for adaptation, and
urban and peri-urban agricultural challenges. On influencing
behavioral change at the individual and institutional levels, the
group identified the need for visionary people or “champions” to
spread the message on adaptation for agriculture and the necessity
of incorporating climate change into development plans. Regarding
food security, participants stressed the importance of appropriate
knowledge for resilient rural agriculture, to avoid mass-migration
to cities. Other issues addressed included: threats posed to farmers
due to urban expansion; land-use conflicts; participatory land-use
planning; increasing the diversification of livelihoods; and
increasing off-farm activities. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Addressing specific actions and expected outcomes, participants
identified a wide range of recommendations, including providing
microcredit and crop insurance to overcome adaptation resource
constraints, and improving access to, and utilization of climate
data. Other strategies mentioned included: </p>

<b>WATER RESOURCES: </b>This group was facilitated by
Taule’ale’ausumai La’avasa Malua, Isikuki Punivalu and Associates,
Samoa, and Khaled Abuzeid, Center for Environment and Development
for the Arab Region and Europe (CEDARE). Participants broke into
four subgroups, focusing on water-supply protection, water
harvesting, watershed management, and salinization. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Regarding water-supply protection, participants identified
efficiency and equity as cross-cutting themes in the context of
water availability, accessibility, scarcity and quality.
Participants identified challenges, including information gaps,
downscaling difficulties, and limits to monitoring all aspects of
the water cycle. Attitudinal constraints were also acknowledged,
including perceptions of water as free and infinite, and lack of
recognition that “one person’s wastewater is another person’s
resource.” <span lang="EN-GB">On possible further actions,
participants pointed to the importance of communication through
different media outlets. They recommended, <i>inter alia</i>: </span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">oversight and quality control of UNFCCC databases; </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">understanding the viability of case studies and guidance on
transferability of case-study approaches; </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">guidance on the social, economic and environmental valuation of
water; </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">better communication between users and generators of scientific
information; and assessing water resources necessary to meet demand,
given climate variability and change.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
On water harvesting, participants considered “for whom” and “for
what purpose.” They noted that water harvesting is taking the flow
of water and turning it into a stock of water for a specific
purpose, but cautioned that doing so could mean giving water to one
group at the expense of another, including the environment, which
can be maladaptive. Conversely, they noted that water harvesting can
be a legitimate and useful component of adaptation. Successful local
approaches were highlighted, such as sand dams in Kenya, but they
underlined the difficulty in applying one solution across many
locations. Participants pointed to the role of forecasting in
supporting decisions regarding how much water to harvest. Regarding
constraints, they noted the importance of public perceptions and
governance issues, in particular relating to the value of water.
<span lang="EN-GB">On possible further actions, participants
highlighted the need to change the perception about rights to water
and to water-intensive livelihoods, especially in situations of
drought or water scarcity. They also suggested coordination across
government agencies. They noted, however, that there is no
one-size-fits-all approach. Participants recommended a focus on how
the UNFCCC can promote the concept of integrated water resources
management, and the use of goodwill ambassadors to make links
between the UNFCCC and adaptation.</span></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
On watershed management, participants observed that developed
countries prepare for climate change through policy and planning,
while developing countries respond to risks. They noted the need to
provide a credible institutional and scientific basis, through data,
technology, and monitoring, acknowledging that this does not
guarantee less difficulty in moving from policy to implementation.
Participants discussed the reliability and usefulness of seasonal or
decadal forecasting for planning, highlighting that poor decisions
are made even with accurate information. <span lang="EN-GB">On
possible further actions, participants noted the importance of
promoting and disseminating good practices, including through the
UNFCCC website. They stressed the need for leadership, noting that
the UNFCCC can only have a catalytic function in this regard.
Participants recommended risk mapping, cost-benefit analyses, and
technology transfer.</span></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<span lang="EN-GB">On salinization, focus was on intrusion of saline
water from sea-level rise and storm surges. Participants noted
current adaptation practices, such as the development of policies
and regulations, regular monitoring and regulation of abstractions,
and the introduction of aquaculture in brackish and saline areas.
They highlighted some examples of cross-sectoral coordination and
existing networks, particularly in West Africa and the Sahel region.
Participants identified constraints, including: the high costs of
desalinization; sociocultural issues related to displacement of
people by loss of land due to salinization; biodiversity loss; and
lack of capacity to maintain infrastructure and technology. On
possible further actions, participants said there are many existing
studies on this issue, but said findings need to be disseminated and
results implemented. They noted that desalinization technology is
not appropriate in all situations. They recommended rehabilitation
of World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and national data
collection networks, and more research funding. </span></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<b>COASTAL ZONES: </b>This group was facilitated by Leon Charles,
Grenada, and Richard Klein, Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI).
Charles pointed to IPCC Working Group II’s chapter on coastal zones
in the Fourth Assessment Report and its division of natural and
human subsystems. Participants broke into smaller groups to discuss
best practices, and gaps, challenges and barriers related to:
research and analysis; policy planning and response; and
implementation of specific measures. The group also discussed
cross-sectoral integration and coordination.</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Regarding gaps and challenges for research and analysis, the group
identified lack of: socioeconomic analysis when identifying
priorities for actions; mechanisms to identify and respond to local
data needs; and the need to understand adaptive capacity. The group
also highlighted: the need to scale up environmental impact
assessments (EIAs) to include climate aspects; gaps in research on
factors affecting indigenous adaptive capacity; erosion of
indigenous knowledge; and that available data is not always accessed or
translated into action or used by decision makers.</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Gaps and challenges in policy responses included the need to: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">resolve conflicts between different stakeholders and incorporate
their needs and preferences;</p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">integrate adaptation measures into sustainable development and

<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">identify lessons learned from disaster risk reduction responses to
determine their applicability for adaptation. </p></li>
</ul>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Regarding implementation, participants noted that many adaptation
activities exist but have not yet been studied, stressed that
continued stakeholder participation is needed, and called for
increased linkages between local, national and regional responses.
They suggested identifying the comparative advantage of the UNFCCC
in supporting adaptation.</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Participants highlighted good practices for research and analysis,
including the ORCHID climate risk management methodology, piloted by
the UK’s Department for International Development, which addresses
the relationship between disaster risk reduction and climate change.
Good practices for policy response included: ecotourism and
generating revenue from conservation; the Caribbean experience of
including climate change in EIAs; the Safe Island Programme in the
Maldives; and a programme in Latin America that<b><i> </i></b>
addresses climate change and information. Good practices in
implementation included: low-tech responses to flooding, such as
keeping drainage systems clear, building houses on stilts and
reinforcing dikes with sand; ecotourism to protect coastal
ecosystems and diversify tourism; and a successful hurricane
preparedness programme in Cuba.</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
The group also addressed how to resolve sectoral conflicts and
integrate coastal zone management when the sectoral emphasis is
still prominent. Also addressed were issues related to
multi-sectoral approaches in developing and implementing plans, and
working across the MEAs through, for example, the UNFCCC, Convention
on Biological Diversity (CBD) and UN Convention to Combat
Desertification (UNCCD) Joint Liaison Group. The UN World Tourism
Organization (UN WTO) pointed to licensing problems for new resorts
in Fiji as approval from several ministries is required. A
multi-sectoral study on coastal zone land suitability in Bangladesh
was highlighted. UNEP drew attention to the Asian Disaster
Preparedness Center’s work in Bangladesh on seasonal models for
agriculture. Another participant urged looking at how implementing
integrated coastal zone management (ICZM), sustainable livelihoods
and other approaches can assist in minimizing vulnerability to
climate change. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
The group proposed the following recommendations and possible
further actions related to research and analysis: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">tailoring climate impact information to specific sectors and other
users, such as tourism and fisheries; </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">monitoring terrestrial variables;

<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">developing mechanisms to insure the most vulnerable.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Policy recommendations included: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">creating enabling environments and a legal framework within the
broader context of sustainable development, ICZM and poverty
reduction strategy papers (PRSPs), and integrating adaptation
considerations into national plans and PRSPs; </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">removing perverse incentives that constrain adaptation activities; </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">promoting the establishment of a global business charter on

</ul>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Recommendations for implementation included: developing and
disseminating tools to facilitate community empowerment, such as
tool kits and brochures in local languages; identifying actions that
address both adaptation and mitigation benefits, such as solar
energy; and developing management models that would facilitate the
scaling up of successful projects without losing the characteristics
that make them successful.</p>
 <p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<b>HEALTH: </b>This group was facilitated by Pablo Suarez, Red
Cross/Red Crescent, and Kristie Ebi, independent consultant.
Assessing the current adaptation practices at sectoral and local
levels within the health sector, Ebi noted that relatively little
has occurred to date. She highlighted that the World Health
Organization (WHO) is preparing a strategy document on adaptation
for COP 13. Participants highlighted limited information, funding
and capacity in developing countries. Questions were raised as to
whether adaptation programmes should be proactive or reactive given
the limited resources and that challenges and entry points for these
types of programmes should be assessed to achieve greater success.
In assessing the status of practices within the sector, participants
emphasized the inadequacy of cross-sectoral coordination and
identification of cross-cutting themes. Some participants identified
the need to incorporate local and indigenous knowledge into
programmes, and to examine rural and urban areas separately when
developing health programmes. Frustration was expressed regarding
limitations to rolling out successful adaptation programmes within
countries due to lack of funding. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Regarding the main barriers and constraints currently encountered
within the health sector, participants encouraged developing a
specific strategy for adaptation to climate change, which would
include standardizing key indicators to monitor changes in the
health impacts of climate change and the effectiveness of adaptation
programmes. Participants noted that conducting in-depth sectoral
studies and discussing results at the national level ensures that
all sectors are represented equally when formulating policy and
strategy. It was also noted that certain adaptation measures within
the health sector can have beneficial “side-effects” for other
sectors and that information flow is key. Knowledge transfer at
different levels was highlighted, with participants expressing
concern that more is not being done to ensure that the public
understands the issues. School-level education programmes were
highlighted as one of the most effective means for ensuring
information dissemination and understanding. Lamenting the lack of
institutional memory, many participants expressed concern at high
staff turnover in organizations worldwide. It was highlighted that
this problem is further exacerbated by a rapidly growing sector that
faces continuing budget constraints. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
On gaps for successful planning and practices and possible solutions
to these problems, participants raised lack of awareness,
cross-sectoral coordination and capacity. A number of actions were
suggested to improve these shortcomings, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">enhancing inter-ministerial and cross-sectoral collaboration; </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">adapting programmes to local situations; </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">strengthening existing infrastructure to meet the health sector’s
needs; </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">enhancing legal frameworks to allow for early warning systems; and
</p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">providing generic methods and tools for identifying problems and
solutions. </p></li>
</ul>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Participants also highlighted the use of traditional knowledge to
address both gaps in knowledge and extend the use of knowledge. Some
expressed concern about overreliance on traditional knowledge, as
some practices may have adverse effects. They also said that climate
change awareness should take place at a local level in order to be
effective Participants stressed the need for awareness and
communication programmes among children, which requires
comparatively less effort. Increased private sector involvement was
also advocated in order to increase research capacity, and apply it
in an effective manner.</p>

Four break-out groups were held under this theme, focused on:
adaptation planning and practices at the national level; adaptation
planning at the subnational level; coordination and integration
across sectors; and coordination and integration at international
and regional levels. In plenary on Tuesday afternoon, presentations
were given on examples of adaptation planning and practices at
different levels. Participants then met in the break-out groups
through Wednesday morning. On Wednesday afternoon, group
facilitators presented discussion outcomes and recommendations to
plenary. The sections below summarize the discussions, including the
outcomes and recommendations.</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
SBI Chair Bagher Asadi (Iran) highlighted outcomes of the three
regional workshops and expert meeting under the SBI. He drew
attention to technical, scientific and socioeconomic aspects of
adaptation planning and practices, regional and international
collaboration, and adaptation activities. He noted that so far, the
UNFCCC process has identified many gaps on adaptation planning and
practices, and hoped that the adaptation planning and practices
workshop would define specific actions to fill these gaps. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Richard Muyungi, Tanzania, gave a brief overview of his country’s
efforts to mainstream climate change adaptation into poverty
eradication activities. He explained issues that were considered
when formulating Tanzania’s national plans, including budgetary and
planning processes, and described methodologies for including
adaptation. He noted a number of steps, such as: providing a
suitable legal and institutional framework; implementing a national
strategy for urgent actions on extreme weather events; increasing
the budget allocation for adaptation programmes; and improving
cross-sectoral collaboration. He observed that the process is
ongoing, and most efforts focus broadly on enhancing capacity to
mainstream.</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Roger Street, UK Climate Impacts Programme, gave an overview of the
UK experience on adaptation planning and practices. He emphasized
that the focus should be on adaptation pathways dealing with risk,
vulnerability, impacts and opportunities of a spatial and temporal
nature and should also aim to deliver on adaptation, while building
adaptive capacity. He highlighted UK initiatives such as the Climate
Change Bill, which is expected to be passed in 2008, directing
resources to support adaptation in priority areas, and the all-party
parliamentary climate change group. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<span lang="EN-GB">Bo Lim, UNDP, spoke on changing the way
“business” is done in organizations, in order to put focus on
adaptation. She said organizations take different approaches when
including climate change in their strategic plans and investment
frameworks. She suggested that change must be aligned with the
organization’s mandate, involving a skilled team. Lim said one way
to begin is by identifying risks and adaptation opportunities in
organizations’ ongoing activities. She described the Adaptation
Learning Mechanism project, which aims to improve effective
integration of adaptation within development organizations. In
conclusion, she suggested pooling knowledge on adaptation to promote
learning, noting that organizations are currently at the stage of
building capacity internally. </span></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Rachel Berger, Practical Action, outlined her organization’s work on
community-based adaptation. She explained that projects focus on
helping members of marginalized communities develop and access
appropriate technologies that can enhance their livelihoods.
Underlining the uncertain future that many of these communities
face, she stressed the importance of involving local government and
stakeholders in projects as this not only improves access to
resources, but also to the knowledge of all those involved. Berger
noted that the NWP could endeavor to make technology available at a
local level to facilitate local communities’ adaptation.</p>

<b>ADAPTATION PLANNING AND PRACTICES AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL: </b>
<span lang="EN-GB">This group was facilitated by Ian Burton and
Habiba Gitay. Participants identified the greatest obstacles to be
addressed at the national level, and made recommendations on
adaptation planning and practices. Discussion addressed how to
generate political will, raise visibility and make adaptation a
priority, and identify funding. Participants raised the issue of
training and capacity-building needs, and pointed to the LDC
National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA) process as useful
for guidance.</span></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<span lang="EN-GB">Participants broke into three subgroups, based on
a compiled and clustered list of obstacles and recommendations,
addressing: lack of integration and/or coordination between
government ministries and departments, and lack of a national
strategy; insufficient science or knowledge, and capacity building
and stakeholders; and lack of leadership or political will and
finance issues.</span></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<span lang="EN-GB">Regarding coordination and national strategies,
participants recommended the development of national-level
architecture, which would include institutions, national adaptation
strategies, action plans and legal frameworks. They suggested the
development of a handbook for integration of adaptation planning and
practices for various sectors, and an indicator-based monitoring and
evaluation system of adaptation planning and practices’
implementation. They called for the establishment of national focal
points on adaptation, which would initiate the establishment of the
national institutional architecture. They also recommended workshops
on sharing good practices on adaptation planning and practices among
countries, which would provide early warning of maladaptive
processes.</span></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<span lang="EN-GB">Regarding capacity building, participants
recommended strengthening and/or developing regional hubs of
knowledge that would build long-term capacity on a number of levels.
Activities would include science-policy communication to mutually
define research activities, creating a national or regional roster
of experts, training and pilot projects. </span></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<span lang="EN-GB">On leadership and finance, participants
reiterated the need to stimulate political will, involve other
relevant ministries, including finance ministries, and the media.
They asked how the NWP can catalyze the necessary political will,
and help convey the importance of adaptation to the highest
political level. They observed that a finance ministers’ meeting
will be held in conjunction with COP 13, and suggested that one goal
is to ensure adaptation is on the meeting’s agenda.</span></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<b>ADAPTATION PLANNING AND PRACTICES AT THE SUBNATIONAL LEVEL: </b>
This group was facilitated by Pablo Suarez and Kristie Ebi. The
facilitators observed that lack of focus on community-level
practices is one weakness of the NWP. Participants initiated
discussions by assessing current practices at the subnational level.
Many noted that local knowledge is important for successful
adaptation practices. Some expressed concern that much of this
knowledge could die out with the elders unless action is taken.
Participants observed that indigenous knowledge can also have
negative adaptation effects, citing examples from Mozambique, where
people refused to evacuate during floods because other species had
not yet reacted. They highlighted the paucity of climate-related
data at the subnational level, and underscored the need for
sensitive data usage in order to avoid delaying actions that have
little need for additional data collection. Participants observed
that short-term programmes may result in the opposite of the
intended effects and that programmes with longer timeframes could be
more successful. They noted that communities have decreased capacity
to respond successfully to successive disasters, calling for
investigation of ways to mitigate this trend. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
The group discussed issues that should be addressed by the NWP at
the subnational level. Participants highlighted the need for
continued knowledge interchange among peers to encourage effective
adaptation practices. They suggested that low-cost, easy-to-use
electronic media would be useful in achieving knowledge interchange
amongst peers, government and NGOs. They noted that some form of
expert review would be necessary in order to ensure the maintenance
of standards. Some members noted the possibility of using low-cost
technology successfully in areas where suitable infrastructure is
not readily available. They also acknowledged the need for the
development of best practices to successfully scale up projects. The
group highlighted the importance of tailoring technologies to local
situations. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Participants broke into smaller groups to discuss matters relating
to: urban community adaptation; communication flows; and information
storage and dissemination. They agreed that three issues need to be
taken into account when implementing adaptation programmes, namely:
the false assumption that actions will trickle down to communities;
the need to integrate local-level initiatives into UNFCCC processes;
and how best to reach vulnerable communities without alienating
national governments. The group highlighted the need to place
greater emphasis on the urban fringes, as they are an increasingly
larger proportion of society. They emphasized that the NWP can help
educate towns, cities and mega-cities on climate change and
adaptation. They also spoke about the need to introduce quality
standards and awards to create more enabling environments for
adaptation to take place. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<b>COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION ACROSS SECTORS: </b>This group was
facilitated by Leon Charles and Richard Klein. In smaller break-out
groups, participants discussed challenges and barriers to
cross-sectoral integration, good practices, factors that facilitate
integration, potential entry points, and recommendations on how the
NWP can assist in promoting and strengthening cross-sectoral
integration. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Good practices were highlighted in relation to coordination among
national and sectoral decision makers, such as in Fiji where
ministries and the private sector are coordinating on tourism. On
coordination during the adaptation planning and design process, good
practices included examples of developing spatial planning
strategies that include multi-sectoral activities and specific tools
to enhance capacity to deal with extreme weather events at the
community level in the UK, and developing integrated adaptive
strategies involving stakeholders from different sectors in Ghana.</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Regarding coordination among national and sectoral decision-makers,
challenges and barriers included: lack of a political mandate and
commitment from, and involvement of those responsible for budgets;
competing interests and cultural differences between sectors; and
lack of structural flexibility in the various sectors. Challenges
related to stakeholder involvement included “stakeholder fatigue,”
where multiple agencies and organizations involve the same
stakeholders simultaneously, and private sector reluctance to get
involved and share information due to concerns about competitiveness
and intellectual property rights.</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Regarding factors that facilitate integration, the group
highlighted: identification of areas where sectors intersect;
engagement of stakeholders across all sectors and at all levels;
high-level political commitment; making issues relevant and
interesting for communities; using climate variability as a starting
point for adaptation to climate change; and creating incentives such
as funding by governments to promote linkages in programmes and
projects. On potential entry points for integration, participants
highlighted: linking adaptation and mitigation strategies;
environmental and health impact assessments; extreme events and
climate-related disasters; and national platforms for disaster risk
reduction. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
The group put forward recommendations related to knowledge sharing
of good practices across sectors, including showcasing and
identifying criteria for good practices, and understanding the
temporal nature of what constitutes a good practice. The group
stressed that the criteria and nature of the case studies is more
important than the studies themselves, since building community
resilience and people’s adaptive capacity is key. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
The group recommended that, under the NWP, the UNFCCC Secretariat
should: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">set up a cross-sectoral expert panel on adaptation; </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">establish an award to stimulate exchange of good practices and
field-visit exchange programmes;</p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">oversee a Wikipedia-type platform on adaptation; </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">provide guidance to UN bodies on how to prioritize adaptation; and
</p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">develop a “how to” guidebook on integrating adaptation.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
The group also recommended that the NWP should encourage
cross-sectoral work on adaptation and development of national action
plans on adaptation, and provide guidance toward developing
effective national adaptation plans. Other recommendations included:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">supporting the development of legal and institutional frameworks at
the national level to promote integration; </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">creating interdepartmental working groups on climate change
adaptation in UN agencies and regional economic commissions; and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">engaging regional and local organizations to promote integration
through pilot projects. </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">Integration in urban areas through organizations, such as
UN-Habitat, the International Council for Local Environmental
Initiatives (ICLEI) and C40 (Cities Climate Leadership Group), was
used an example.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="ENB-Body" style="page-break-after: avoid; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px" align="justify">

<b>COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION AT THE INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL
LEVELS: </b>This group was facilitated by Khaled Abuzeid and
Taule’ale’ausumai La’avasa Malua. On promoting the integration and
coordination of adaptation, various organizations highlighted their
activities. The UN’s International Strategy for Disaster Reduction
(ISDR) discussed initiatives to build capacity for reducing disaster
risk such as the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, in
addition to joint work programming and coordination between ISDR,
other UN agencies and NGOs to identify priority areas for actions. A
participant discussed PRECIS, a software package to assess local
climate risk developed at the Hadley Centre, UK, aimed at developing
countries, which facilitates technology transfer coupled with
capacity building and training. The US Agency for International
Development described SERVIR, a web portal serving Central America
and Mexico, which develops and disseminates climate information such
as real-time tide predictions, storm tracking and fire warnings,
while encouraging information sharing across borders. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
The group addressed challenges and opportunities facing integration
and coordination of adaptation planning. They prioritized the need
for clear mapping of the different actors in adaptation and their
respective roles. Differing timescales, with some organizations
being interested in immediate-term adaptation and others taking a
longer-term view, was viewed as an obstacle coupled with the
differing planning cycles within organizations. The disparity of
requests by parties to the different conventions was cited as a
challenge because it results in ineffectual coordination, overlaps
and conflicting mandates between conventions. Another challenge is
linking national capacity self-assessment to international
initiatives. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Regarding opportunities, the group suggested: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">compiling meta-data on key players by theme or sector;
</p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">more effective application of Internet technology, bearing in mind
usability; </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">developing areas of comparative advantage and promoting further
action; </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">monitoring the degree of climate change integration;
</p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">promoting incentives for more action;
</p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">catalyzing the broad application of regional climate models such as
PRECIS; and </p></li>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">widely disseminating results.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
On ways forward, the group proposed: actions and recommendations;
modalities for facilitating access to data and tools, including
models and their outputs: and developing regional adaptation
projects and activities. On proposed actions, the group suggested
mapping agencies and their activities, including bilateral projects
and national needs to facilitate coordination of actions, and
requesting the UNFCCC to coordinate and broker action on adaptation
through the NWP, involving financing and implementing agencies and
other organizations. Under facilitating access to data and tools,
the group suggested providing an interface to access data from
different sources for specific adaptation needs to overcome data
access constraints experienced by many countries and regions. They
also recommended the establishment of a portal under the NWP on key
adaptation needs linked to existing resources. Finally, under
regional adaptation projects and activities the group suggested
mapping regional organizations and institutions that can participate
in the NWP, for example the African Ministerial Conference on the
Environment and the African Ministers’ Council on Water. They also
recommended the coordination of activities and the development of
mandates under different multilateral processes as a basis for
inter-agency collaboration. Coordinating CBD Subsidiary Body on
Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice proposals on
adaptation planning with UNFCCC adaptation work under the NAPAs and
the NWP was also proposed as a possibility.</p>

<b>ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION ON RECOMMEND-ATIONS AND ACTION PLEDGES:</b>
Chair Kumarsingh requested participating organizations to respond to
two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="ENB-Bulleted" align="justify" style="margin:10px; ">
<font size="1" face="Verdana"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Based on the workshop, what potential future actions can each

</li>
</ul>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
Over 20 organizations spoke, including the three Convention expert
groups. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
The EGTT described tools and activities developed, including the
technical paper on technologies for adaptation published in 2006. He
noted that the EGTT supports the NWP at the interface between
planning and strategies through concrete pilot projects. The CGE
pointed to experience with tools and methodologies used for
vulnerability and adaptation assessments in national communications,
and the training of trainers. The LEG said that it is willing to
work with non-LDCs to use methodologies developed for the LDC NAPAs,
of which 21 have been completed, with the majority of the rest
expected before COP 13. He also
pointed to the early stages of implementation of NAPA projects,
which he said could also be good input to the NWP.</p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
CEDARE mentioned ongoing work with the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) focused
on capacity building and said its decision support system for the NBI
can be made available for replication elsewhere. ISDR reiterated commitment to the NWP,
highlighting two relevant activities: efforts among several agencies
to align work on disaster risk reduction and adaptation; and a
drought risk reduction network. She said ISDR pledges to assist in
the coordination of a campaign to raise awareness among children on
health impacts of climate change. The Munich Climate Insurance
Initiative (MCII) highlighted intentions to conduct a pilot study in
developing countries to assess what insurance-related initiatives
can take place. She said MCII would benefit from the NWP due to the
increasing demand for risk management that can enhance adaptation
planning and practices. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development highlighted that adaptation is progressively more
important for member states but that many divisions in the
organization still do not prioritize adaptation. Practical Action
emphasized commitment to continuing the development of the current
fieldwork model, and more widely disseminating project results. She
also expressed willingness to facilitate the involvement of a
greater number of stakeholders for community-based projects. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
SEI described work on “building a bridge between assessment and
technical capacity,” and, among other activities, setting up a
climate adaptation network based in Africa. UNEP said it is
developing a climate change strategy, in addition to developing
appropriate data and information to increase “scientific
robustness.” The UNESCO Institute for Higher Education (UNESCO-IHE)
outlined activities for water education, which aim to increase the
knowledge and skills of professionals working in the water sector,
as well as building a climate change and adaptation programme. The
Cooperative Programme on Water and Climate explained that it is
stimulating the introduction of climate issues into the water
sector. <span lang="EN-GB">United Nations University/Institute for
Environment and Human Security (UNU/EHS) said elements of the NWP
have been written into the organization’s work programme for the
coming two years, including projects on water and adaptation, and
maladaptation and human security, in addition to 15 case studies on
adaptation to climate variability. She said the NWP will benefit
UNU/EHS by facilitating dissemination of research findings to policy
makers. </span></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<span lang="EN-GB">UN WTO suggested five concrete actions that it could take:
developing guidelines and tools for the tourism sector; developing
climate change risk assessment tools for the tourism business;
including the tourism sector in national adaptation strategies;
discussing and sharing good practices; and facilitating access to
and dissemination of tools. WHO highlighted mechanisms for
contributing to the NWP, including: contributing socioeconomic
health information to climate vulnerability assessments; supporting
research; technical support; and facilitating the availability of
lessons learned. </span>WMO expressed willingness to contribute to
the NWP through activities such as data management activities and
regional climate services. He also underscored commitment to
building capacity. The World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) said
his organization is aiming to address climate scenarios and
downscaling. He noted that the WCRP is developing a systematic
approach to address regional downscaling. The World Bank stressed
relevant contributions to the NWP, including a study to estimate the
costs and financial flows of adaptation. He stressed that the World
Bank is aiming to earmark specific funds and create new financial
instruments for adaptation. </p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<span lang="EN-GB">The Global Change System for Analysis, Research
and Training (START) noted efforts on research capacity building,
highlighting ongoing activities in Africa and South-East Asia to
support post-graduate studies. He requested guidance through the NWP
on research capacity gaps where START can contribute. </span>FAO
explained that the NWP enables his organization to fit ongoing
agricultural development and food security activities into the
climate change and adaptation realm. IW: LEARN outlined project
activities and linkages to adaptation and climate change.
<span lang="EN-GB">ICLEI pointed to the ongoing activities in
cities, which he said are increasingly at risk from climate change.
The Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research highlighted relevant
activities, including an upcoming conference on “Are there limits to
adaptation?” to be held in London in February 2008.</span></p>
<p class="ENB-Body" align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<span lang="EN-GB">Chair Kumarsingh lauded the pledges, and opened
the floor for final comments. The Centre for European Policy Studies
called for an informal platform for the exchange of practices and
expertise, as an alternative to formal submissions to the
Secretariat, which she said do not accurately reflect adaptation
information “from the ground.” Chile urged considering how the NWP
can help countries raise the concern of climate change at the
highest political levels.</span></p>

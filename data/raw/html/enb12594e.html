<p>The Warsaw Climate Change Conference took place from 11-23 November 2013 in Poland. It included the 19th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 19) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the ninth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 9). The conference also included meetings of three subsidiary bodies: the 39th sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 39) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI 39), and the third part of the second session of the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP 2).</p>
<p>Marking the second time that UN climate change negotiations have taken place in Poland, the conference drew over 8,300 participants, including 4,022 government officials, 3,695 representatives of UN bodies and agencies, intergovernmental organizations and civil society organizations, and 658 members of the media.</p>
<p>Negotiations in Warsaw focused on the implementation of agreements reached at previous meetings, including pursuing the work of the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action. Concluding 27 hours after its scheduled closing time, the meeting adopted an ADP decision that invites parties to initiate or intensify domestic preparations for their intended nationally-determined contributions, and resolves to accelerate the full implementation of the Bali Action Plan and pre-2020 ambition. Parties also adopted a decision establishing the Warsaw international mechanism on loss and damage, and the “Warsaw REDD+ framework,” a series of seven decisions on REDD+ finance, institutional arrangements and methodological issues.</p>
<p><strong>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL </strong></p>
<p>The international political response to climate change began with the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992, which sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to avoid “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” The Convention, which entered into force on 21 March 1994, now has 195 parties.</p>
<p>In December 1997, delegates to COP 3 in Kyoto, Japan, agreed to a protocol to the UNFCCC that committed industrialized countries and countries in transition to a market economy to achieve emission reduction targets. These countries, known as Annex I parties under the UNFCCC, agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six GHGs by an average of 5% below 1990 levels in 2008-2012 (first commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to country. The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005 and now has 192 parties.</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM NEGOTIATIONS IN 2005-2009:</strong>  Convening in Montreal, Canada, in 2005, CMP 1 decided to establish the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Working Group on Annex I Parties’ Further Commitments under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-KP) in accordance with Protocol Article 3.9, which mandated consideration of Annex I parties’ further commitments at least seven years before the end of the first commitment period.  COP 11 created a process to consider long-term cooperation under the Convention through a series of four workshops known as “the Convention Dialogue.”</p>
<p>In December 2007, COP 13 and CMP 3 in Bali, Indonesia, resulted in agreement on the Bali Roadmap on long-term issues. COP 13 adopted the Bali Action Plan and established the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention (AWG-LCA) with a mandate to focus on mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology and a shared vision for long-term cooperative action. Negotiations on Annex I parties’ further commitments continued under the AWG-KP. The deadline for concluding the two-track negotiations was Copenhagen in 2009.</p>
<p><strong>COPENHAGEN: </strong>The UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, took place in December 2009. The high-profile event was marked by disputes over transparency and process. During the high-level segment, informal negotiations took place in a group consisting of major economies and representatives of regional and other negotiating groups. Late in the evening of 18 December these talks resulted in a political agreement, the “Copenhagen Accord,” which was then presented to the COP plenary for adoption. After 13 hours of debate, delegates ultimately agreed to “take note” of the Copenhagen Accord. In 2010, over 140 countries indicated support for the Accord. More than 80 countries also provided information on their national mitigation targets or actions. Parties also agreed to extend the mandates of the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP until COP 16 and CMP 6 in 2010.</p>
<p><strong>CANCUN:</strong> The UN Climate Change Conference in Cancun, Mexico, took place in December 2010, where parties finalized the Cancun Agreements. Under the Convention track, Decision 1/CP.16 recognized the need for deep cuts in global emissions in order to limit the global average temperature rise to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Parties agreed to consider strengthening the global long-term goal during a Review by 2015, including in relation to a proposed 1.5°C target. They took note of emission reduction targets and nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) communicated by developed and developing countries, respectively. Decision 1/CP.16 also addressed other aspects of mitigation, such as: measuring, reporting and verification (MRV); and reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD+).</p>
<p>The Cancun Agreements also established several new institutions and processes, including the Cancun Adaptation Framework, Adaptation Committee, and the Technology Mechanism, which includes the Technology Executive Committee (TEC) and the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN). The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was created and designated as an operating entity of the Convention’s financial mechanism governed by a 24-member board. Parties agreed to set up a Transitional Committee tasked with the Fund’s design and a Standing Committee to assist the COP with respect to the financial mechanism. Parties also recognized the commitment by developed countries to provide US$30 billion of fast-start finance in 2010-2012, and to jointly mobilize US$100 billion per year by 2020.</p>
<p>Under the Protocol track, the CMP urged Annex I parties to raise the level of ambition towards achieving aggregate emission reductions consistent with the range identified in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and adopted Decision 2/CMP.6 on land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). The mandates of the two AWGs were extended for another year.</p>
<p><strong>DURBAN:</strong> The UN Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa, took place from 28 November to 11 December 2011. The Durban outcomes covered a wide range of topics, notably the establishment of a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, a decision on long-term cooperative action under the Convention and agreement on the operationalization of the GCF. Parties also agreed to launch the new ADP with a mandate “to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties.” The ADP is scheduled to complete these negotiations by 2015. The new instrument should enter into effect from 2020 onwards. In addition, the ADP was also mandated to explore actions to close the pre-2020 ambition gap in relation to the 2°C target.</p>
<p><strong>DOHA:</strong> The UN Climate Change Conference in Doha, Qatar, took place from 26 November to 8 December 2012. The conference resulted in a package of decisions, referred to as the “Doha Climate Gateway.” These include amendments to the Kyoto Protocol to establish its second commitment period and agreement to terminate the AWG-KP’s work in Doha. The parties also agreed to terminate the AWG-LCA and negotiations under the Bali Action Plan. A number of issues requiring further consideration were transferred to the SBI and SBSTA, such as: the 2013-15 review of the global goal; developed and developing country mitigation; the Kyoto Protocol’s flexibility mechanisms; national adaptation plans (NAPs); MRV; market and non-market mechanisms; and REDD+. Key elements of the Doha outcome also included agreement to consider loss and damage, “such as an institutional mechanism to address loss and damage in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.”</p>
<p><strong>ADP 2:</strong> ADP 2 met in Bonn, Germany, from 29 April to 3 May 2013. The session was structured around workshops and roundtable discussions, covering the ADP’s two workstreams. Many felt this format was helpful in moving the ADP discussions forward. Several delegates noted, however, that the ADP needs to become more focused and interactive in future sessions.</p>
<p><strong>BONN:</strong> The Bonn Climate Change Conference took place from 3-14 June 2013. SBI 38 was characterized by an agenda dispute concerning a proposal by the Russian Federation, Belarus and Ukraine to introduce a new item on legal and procedural issues related to decision-making under the COP and CMP. As no solution to the dispute was found, the SBI was unable to launch substantive work. SBSTA 38 achieved what many saw as good progress, <em>inter alia</em>, on REDD+ and several methodological issues. The resumed ADP 2 was structured around workshops and roundtables. No agreement was reached on establishing one or more contact groups to move part of the work to a more formal setting. Many, however, felt that switching to a negotiating mode will be important to ensure that the ADP makes progress in future sessions.</p>
<p><strong>REPORT OF THE WARSAW CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE </strong></p>
<p>COP 19 and CMP 9 opened on Monday morning, 11 November 2013. COP 18/CMP 8 President Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, Qatar, highlighted the Doha Climate Gateway and progress made in Doha. Marcin Korolec, Minister of the Environment, Poland, called on “each party to contribute an ingredient to help cure the planet,” expressing hope that COP 19 will build a solid foundation for addressing climate change. Reminding delegates of the Olympic motto “faster, higher, stronger,” UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres underscored that what happens at the National Stadium in Warsaw “is not a game: we either all win or lose.”</p>
<p>Welcoming delegates, Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, Mayor of Warsaw, highlighted her city’s sustainable activities in water management, transportation and energy. Reporting on unprecedented changes in the climate system and their consequences, IPCC Chair Rajendra Pachauri stressed the need for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to peak by 2015 and increasing the share of renewable energy.</p>
<p>This report summarizes the discussions by the COP, CMP, ADP, SBI and SBSTA based on their respective agendas. Negotiations and outcomes under the COP and CMP on issues forwarded to the SBI, SBSTA and ADP are summarized in the context of negotiations under the relevant subsidiary body.</p>
<p><strong><em>CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES </em></strong></p>

<p><strong>2013-2015 REVIEW:</strong> These discussions are summarized under the SBI agenda item on the 2013-2015 review (see page 20).</p>
<p><strong>MATTERS RELATING TO FINANCE: Work Programme on Long-term Finance:</strong> This issue (FCCC/CP/2013/7) was taken up by the COP on Wednesday, 13 November. Long-term Finance (LTF) Work Programme Co-Chair Mark Storey (Sweden) reported on the extended work programme on LTF, highlighting the need for transparency in the definition and tracking of LTF, and calling for identifying ways of scaling up private finance for adaptation.</p>
<p>The Philippines, for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), said a successful outcome in 2015 depends on progress on predictability, accountability and sustainability of LTF. Egypt, for the African Group, underlined that the level of action on climate change is related to the level of support provided to developing countries. Maldives encouraged developed countries to reach a burden-sharing agreement to reach the US$100 billion annual goal. Colombia, for the Association of Independent Latin American and Caribbean states (AILAC), urged: clarity and predictability in the provision of finance; clarity in the scale of resources to be mobilized; and sufficient funding for the Adaptation Fund. The European Union (EU) indicated that it has fulfilled and reported on LTF obligations. The Republic of Korea suggested setting up a working group on LTF to start a political dialogue on this issue.</p>
<p>This issue was further discussed in a contact group co-chaired by Kamel Djemouai (Algeria) and Herman Sips (the Netherlands), together with all other COP finance sub-items except REDD+ (namely: report of the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF), report of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and guidance, arrangement between the COP and the GCF, report of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and guidance, and fifth review of the financial mechanism), which convened throughout the meeting.</p>
<p>In the contact group on Wednesday, 13 November, parties exchanged views on prioritization and sequencing of sub-items. The Philippines, for the G-77/China, suggested sequencing from easier to more difficult. The EU proposed having “a clear starting and landing point,” and the US stated it looks forward to the high-level ministerial dialogue on finance. Many parties agreed that the sub-item on arrangements between the GCF and the COP is the least contentious one, while LTF is the most difficult one. Many developing countries, including Colombia, for AILAC, and Saudi Arabia, stressed LTF as a priority.</p>
<p>Discussions on the sub-items, based on their alphabetical order on the COP agenda, continued, starting with LTF, on Thursday, 14 November. Most developing countries stressed a COP decision on LTF as one of the most important ones. Some urged implementation of Convention Article 4.7 (finance and technology transfer), stressing that the provision of resources is an obligation for governments, and noting that financial resources contributing towards the US$100 billion target will not be “new,” but constitute delivery of a commitment already taken. A number of developing countries called for, <em>inter alia</em>, more concrete outcomes, and clarity and predictability in the form of mid-term targets or quantified pathways to the US$100 billion target. Many developed countries underscored the need for effectiveness and enabling environments. Some developed countries indicated that no financing commitments would be made in Warsaw and rejected quantified pathways, emphasizing work undertaken towards achieving the 2020 goal. Most concurred on the importance of efforts to achieve the 2°C target; as well as transparency and trust-building.</p>
<p>In the COP/CMP President’s informal stocktaking plenary on Thursday, 21 November, the COP President reported he had requested Ministers Maria Kiwanuka (Uganda) and Martin Lidegaard (Denmark) to hold consultations aimed at resolving outstanding issues. On 22 November, Minister Ephraim Kamuntu (Uganda) replaced Minister Kiwanuka.</p>
<p>After extensive consultations, on Saturday, 23 November, the COP adopted the decision.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome:</em></strong> In its decision (FCCC/CP/2013/L.13), the COP, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>

<p><strong>Report of the GCF to the COP and guidance to the GCF:</strong> This issue (FCCC/CP/2013/6, 8 and MISC.3) was taken up by the COP on Wednesday, 13 November. Former GCF Co-Chair Zaheer Fakir (South Africa) presented the report, and informed that Manfred Konukiewitz (Germany) and Jose Maria Clemente Sarte Salceda (Philippines) had been elected as the new GCF Co-Chairs. The Philippines, for the G-77/China, Maldives, for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), and others called for a rapid and substantial operationalization and capitalization of the GCF. The G-77/China underscored that the Fund’s Private Sector Facility will be country-driven and will pursue sustainable development. The African Group called for an initial mobilization, a replenishment process, and a focus on adaptation finance. India called for balancing mitigation and adaptation funding. The issue was further discussed in the contact group co-chaired by Djemouai and Sips. On Saturday, 23 November, the COP adopted the decision.</p>

<p><strong>Decision-making in the UNFCCC process:</strong> This issue was taken up by the COP on Monday, 11 November. COP President Korolec underlined that the proposed new item on decision-making in the UNFCCC process is distinct from the item on the rules of procedure, and the proposal by Papua New Guinea and Mexico to amend Convention Articles 7 and 18. He also assured parties that discussions on this new item will be forward-looking and that its inclusion will not prejudge outcomes.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, 13 November, during the COP plenary, Fiji, for the G-77/China, requested that the informal consultations be open-ended and cautioned against duplication, prejudice and overlap. Informal consultations facilitated by Vice Minister Gabriel Quijandria Acosta (Peru) and Vice Minister Beata Jaczewska (Poland) were held throughout the meeting. Some parties sought reassurance that this issue would not be conflated with, or prejudge the outcome of, discussions on the rules of procedure; and the proposal from Papua New Guinea and Mexico to amend Convention Articles 7 and 18. Some parties emphasized the need to understand the meaning of “consensus,” and to clarify the role of the presiding officer and the Secretariat. One party stressed the need for “a clear legal environment, where we do not deviate from procedures that are not in force but yet applied.” Others highlighted that the rules of procedure have not been adopted because of lack of agreement on voting rules, and called for a forward-looking process, without re-opening past decisions.</p>
<p>There was convergence on a party-driven process and the need to: respect the sovereignty of all parties; recognize that all have an opportunity to be heard; and ensure inclusiveness, legitimacy and transparency. Some parties emphasized the need to avoid taking decisions “in the corridors or backrooms,” citing COP 15 as an example. While there was some convergence on the timeliness of discussions to increase the effectiveness of negotiations, some expressed concern over “sacrificing inclusiveness for effectiveness.” Others called for revisiting recent practices that favored the adoption of decisions as “a package.” Many questioned the way small negotiating groups are constituted, stressing that some parties with an interest in the issue may not get invited. On Saturday, 23 November, the COP adopted conclusions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome:</em></strong> In its conclusions (FCCC/CP/2013/L.3), the COP:</p>
<p>•  notes the initial exchange of views on this agenda item and decides to continue discussions on decision-making in the UNFCCC process;</p>
<p>•  requests the President, in collaboration with Peru as the host of COP 20, to undertake forward-looking, open-ended informal consultations on decision-making in the UNFCCC process in conjunction with the 40th session of the SBs;</p>
<p>•  agrees that items 2(b) and 6(b) of the COP 19 agenda on rules of procedure and on the proposal from Papua New Guinea and Mexico, would continue to be considered under distinct and separate processes from this item; and</p>
<p>•  agrees to continue its consideration of this item at COP 20.</p>
<p><strong>HIGH-LEVEL MINISTERIAL DIALOGUE ON CLIMATE FINANCE:</strong> On Wednesday, 20 November, a two-part ministerial dialogue mandated by COP 18 considered progress in mobilizing long-term climate finance, including efforts by developed countries to scale up finance after 2012.</p>
<p>The keynote speakers were UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, President Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete (United Republic of Tanzania), GEF CEO and Chairperson Naoko Ishii, GCF Executive Director Hela Cheikhrouhou, and Nicholas Stern, London School of Economics. The dialogue was co-chaired by Ministers Maria Kiwanuka (Uganda) and Martin Lidegaard (Denmark).</p>
<p>During the first part of the dialogue, participants were invited to consider the “state of play” and progress in scaling up climate finance, including: gaps after the fast-start finance period; ways to build momentum for public finance, especially for adaptation; and challenges in mobilizing climate finance. Opening “icebreaker” statements were given by Minister Lisel Alamilla (Belize), Minister Dalila Boudjemaa (Algeria), Minister Peter Altmeier (Germany), and Todd Stern, Special Envoy for Climate Change (US).</p>
<p>During the second part, participants were asked to explore efforts being undertaken to scale up the mobilization of climate finance, <em>inter alia</em>: collective policy and regulatory actions to redirect private finance flows; facilitative actions for effective deployment of climate finance; and strategies by individual developed countries. “Icebreaker” statements were delivered by Minister Tine Sundtoft (Norway), Secretary of State Edward Davey (UK), and Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources Juan José Guerra Abud (Mexico).</p>

<p><strong><em>COP 19 AND CMP 9 JOINT HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT </em></strong></p>
<p>The joint COP/CMP high-level segment was held on 19, 21 and 22 November. Donald Tusk, Prime Minister of Poland, opened the high-level segment and welcomed participants. Noting that Poland is hosting the COP/CMP for the second time, he outlined emerging challenges since Poznan: the financial crisis; failure to achieve a global agreement in Copenhagen; shifts in the world energy market; and recent IPCC findings. Emphasizing that “we cannot afford a failure; and cannot play with the climate,” he said the key goal for Warsaw is to produce a “sober assessment” of what is necessary to achieve a global agreement.</p>
<p>Calling Warsaw an important stepping stone, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon signaled a “steep climb” ahead. Among areas for action, he highlighted: ratifying the Kyoto Protocol’s second commitment period; increasing ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance for a large-scale transformation; sending the right policy signals to investors; and constructing an action agenda to meet the climate challenge by laying a firm foundation for the 2015 agreement</p>
<p>UN General Assembly President John Ashe stated that, although he understands the challenges of negotiations, “the picture outside this room is bleak.” He said parties must reach a deal in 2015, which should include pre-2020 ambition, a compliance mechanism, and applicability to all.</p>
<p>UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres said COP 19 is held in the context of “a clarion call from science, and a compelling call from the Philippines.” She stressed the need for Warsaw to pave the way to Lima and Paris, and called for ministers’ active involvement on core deliverables: finance; “a cornerstone for” the loss and damage mechanism; increased pre-2020 ambition; and elements of the new agreement.</p>
<p>The high-level segment continued with statements from heads of state and government, deputy heads of state and government, ministers, and other heads of delegations. A webcast of the statements is available at: <a href="https://bit.ly/HX8VgK">http://bit.ly/HX8VgK</a></p>
<p><strong><em>AD HOC WORKING GROUP ON THE DURBAN PLATFORM FOR ENHANCED ACTION (ADP) </em></strong></p>
<p>The opening plenary of the third part of the second session of the ADP (ADP 2-3), co-chaired by Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) and Artur Runge-Metzger (EU), took place on Tuesday, 12 November. The ADP’s work was based on: the agenda (ADP/2013/AGENDA) adopted at the first part of ADP 2; and the Co-Chairs’ scenario note (ADP.2013.16.InformalNote). For a summary of the opening statements, see: <a href="/vol12/enb12585e.html">http://enb.iisd.org/vol12/enb12585e.html</a></p>
<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS:</strong> <strong>Election of Officers</strong>: At the ADP closing plenary on Saturday, 23 November, Co-Chair Kumarsingh announced that Anna Serzysko (Poland) would be the new ADP Rapporteur commencing after ADP 2-3.</p>
<p><strong>IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL THE ELEMENTS OF DECISION 1/CP.17:</strong> On Tuesday, 12 November, the ADP began with a briefing and discussion on the overview of mandates and progress of work by institutions, mechanisms and arrangements under the Convention (FCCC/ADP/2013/INF.2). Guided by questions from the Co-Chairs, subsequent work during the first week took place under the two workstreams. Workstream 1 (2015 agreement) was discussed in open-ended consultations on content and elements of the 2015 agreement, including adaptation, mitigation, technology, finance, capacity-building, and transparency. Workstream 2 (pre-2020 ambition) was discussed in open-ended consultations on the way forward, as well as workshops on lessons learned from relevant experience of other multilateral environmental agreements, and on pre-2020 ambition, urbanization and the role of governments in facilitating climate action in cities.</p>
<p> During the second week, the ADP’s work consisted of: negotiations based on a Co-Chairs’ draft decision and conclusions in open-ended informal consultations on implementation of all the elements of Decision 1/CP.17; a Co-Chairs’ special event; and a high-level ministerial dialogue on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action. The ADP decision and conclusions were adopted during the closing plenary on Saturday, 23 November.</p>
<p><strong>OVERVIEW OF INSTITUTIONS, MECHANISMS AND ARRANGEMENTS UNDER THE CONVENTION:</strong> On Tuesday, 12 November, Co-Chair Runge-Metzger identified the state of play under the Convention as “a natural entry point” into discussions under both ADP workstreams. The Secretariat presented the overview (FCCC/ADP/2013/INF.2), noting an online interface for future reference.</p>
<p> <strong>WORKSTREAM 1:</strong> <strong>Adaptation:</strong> Co-Chair Kumarsingh drew attention to the technical paper on adaptation (FCCC/TP/2013/10) during the ADP opening plenary on Tuesday, 12 November. Many parties appreciated the signal sent by holding the first ADP open-ended consultations on adaptation. During informal consultations on Wednesday, 13 November, the Secretariat introduced the synthesis of submissions on the costs, benefits and opportunities for adaptation (FCCC/TP/2013/10).</p>
<p> Many parties indicated that the 2015 agreement should: reflect the urgency of adaptation to signal to international institutions, donor countries and the private sector the need for partnerships; recognize parties’ ongoing adaptation efforts; contain a holistic review component assessing national and global actions and needs; and strengthen the financial mechanism. Stressing transparency as key to building confidence, one party urged finalizing MRV arrangements and clarifying further pledges in Warsaw.</p>
<p> During open-ended consultations on Friday, 15 November, parties examined: strengthening the current adaptation framework; and adaptation in the 2015 agreement, including a proposed global goal. Many countries recognized the central role of NAPs, and underlined the global, regional, national and local dimensions of adaptation. Peru reiterated the proposal by AILAC to use national communications to reinforce NAPs and identify gaps. Saudi Arabia said NAPs should be a requirement for all countries. Indonesia, China and the Republic of Korea stressed the link between adaptation and sustainable development.</p>
<p>On finance, Malaysia, for the G-77/China, with India, China, Kenya and Egypt, expressed concern over lack of funding for adaptation. Mali called for funding for NAPs. India highlighted financing for technology transfer. The US indicated its commitment to support adaptation.</p>
<p>On institutional arrangements, many called for strengthening the existing institutions addressing adaptation under the Convention.</p>
<p>The G-77/China, Bangladesh, Kenya and others called for a global adaptation goal based on the proposal made by the African Group, determined by estimating adaptation needs according to emission scenarios. Australia, Norway, the Republic of Korea and the US stressed the technical difficulty of aggregating adaptation to a quantified global goal, with the US adding that setting such a goal could be counter-productive. ADP Co-Chair Kumarsingh invited the African Group, Australia, the US and others to consult on the proposed global goal on adaptation. Nepal, the Philippines and Nauru, for AOSIS, stressed the link between mitigation and adaptation. AOSIS stressed that small island developing states (SIDS) will be unable to adapt to some climate change impacts, and underscored that only ambitious and timely mitigation can reduce loss and damage.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> During informal consultations on Wednesday, 13 November, a number of parties agreed on the importance to ensure broad participation in the 2015 agreement. Some stressed that mitigation commitments must be differentiated in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR), and that enhanced mitigation by developing countries depends on the provision of means of implementation.</p>
<p> Calls were made for agreement in Warsaw on launching national consultations on mitigation pledges. Parties also discussed the process for defining mitigation commitments. Some identified the need to balance the flexibility of nationally determined commitments and the rigidity of commonly agreed rules. Suggestions were made to create “an upward spiral of ambition” with facilitative engagement to compare commitments among countries. It was also proposed that the 2015 agreement be flexible and adjustable to developments in science and capabilities. One party stressed that commitments must be fulfilled by domestic means, without relying on offsets. Parties discussed historical responsibilities, with some proposing to mandate the IPCC to develop a methodology, while others indicated that a focus on historical responsibilities will not ensure achievement of the 2°C goal.</p>
<p> <strong>Technology:</strong> On Thursday, 14 November, parties agreed to open all open-ended consultations to observers. Co-Chair Kumarsingh invited parties to focus their discussions on how technology development and transfer could be reflected in the 2015 agreement and institutional arrangements for the post-2020 period.</p>
<p> Malaysia, for the G-77/China, stressed that technology development and transfer are key to enable low-emission trajectories in developing countries, and called for identification of specific amounts, timelines and sources of finance to strengthen the current reporting system. Venezuela lamented the lack of financial support.</p>
<p>Egypt, for the Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDCs), China and others called for a dedicated window for technology transfer in the GCF. The LMDCs, with Pakistan, called for a work programme on MRV of technological support, and, with China, Ecuador and others, the removal of barriers, including in relation to intellectual property rights (IPRs). India and Pakistan emphasized finance for IPRs. The LMDCs, China, Kuwait and others said the GCF could provide a dedicated window for IPR issues. Japan opposed taking up IPRs, while Bolivia, with Cuba, called for a workshop on this issue.</p>
<p>On the 2015 agreement, Nauru, for AOSIS, emphasized linking technology development and transfer to the financial mechanism. AOSIS, the LMDCs, Nepal, for the LDCs, and others urged technology development and transfer for mitigation and adaptation. Bolivia called for: strengthening the role of the TEC; a workshop to explore its mandate to guide the CTCN; and a repository of reliable technologies accessible to developing countries.</p>
<p>On institutional arrangements for the post-2020 period, AOSIS emphasized linking technology transfer and development to existing institutions under the financial mechanism. The LDCs said a technology mechanism should be integrated into the new agreement.</p>
<p>Consultations continued on Friday, 15 November. The US, with Canada, highlighted IPRs as critical for innovation. Canada emphasized that IPRs are sufficiently addressed in other fora. The US, the EU and Switzerland stated that IPRs are not the main barrier to technology transfer. Together with South Africa and Swaziland, for the African Group, the Philippines called for a built-in review mechanism for addressing the adequacy of support.</p>
<p>The African Group also called for Annex I countries to leverage private-sector support and for learning from other multilateral agreements. The EU suggested the 2015 agreement promote international technology cooperation, and emphasized the role of the CTCN and the public and private sectors. He added that the Technology Mechanism should be the technology component for the post-2020 period and stressed the importance of enabling environments. Parties also called for: mapping technology needs through technology needs assessments; supporting traditional and indigenous knowledge transfer; engaging with other intergovernmental institutions to avoid duplication; and promoting synergies between the Technology Mechanism bodies.</p>
<p><strong>Finance:</strong> During open-ended consultations on Thursday, 14 November, delegates considered climate finance in the 2015 agreement for the implementation of post-2020 commitments and post-2020 institutional arrangements.</p>
<p> Bolivia, China, Cuba, Ecuador, Kuwait, Iran, Nicaragua, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone and Venezuela questioned the proposed focus, stressing that developing countries are uncomfortable with concentrating on post-2020 issues without first discussing pre-2020 finance. Switzerland supported the Co-Chairs’ proposed approach, saying that focused discussions will enable real progress. Most parties agreed that the 2015 agreement should build on existing institutions, noting the need for their enhancement. Many developing countries called for: new, additional and scaled up finance; public finance to be the main source of climate finance; MRV of support; a finance chapter in the 2015 agreement with the same legal force as the agreement’s other elements; aggregate and individual targets for developed countries’ financial commitments; and a finance roadmap. Concerned about suggestions implying financial commitments to be taken on by developing countries, some delegates also emphasized that South-South cooperation should be regarded as “voluntary efforts.”</p>
<p>Several developed countries emphasized the role of enabling environments in encouraging financial flows. Japan and the US underscored the need to incentivize both public and private investment, with the US identifying public finance as key for the LDCs, and highlighting the role of private finance in middle- and high-income economies. The US also observed that legally-binding elements of the 2015 agreement are yet to be determined. Canada said public finance alone will not suffice to address the needs of the poorest.</p>
<p>Switzerland highlighted the role of biennial reviews by the SCF, and the need to strengthen MRV of both public and private finance. He called for strengthened commitment with respect to the overall amount and donor base. Norway underlined the need for public finance for adaptation, and called for parties to use carbon-pricing and cost-effective market mechanisms to ensure compliance with the polluter-pays principle. Bangladesh stressed predictable adaptation finance.</p>
<p><strong>Capacity-building:</strong> During open-ended consultations on Friday, 15 November, parties recognized that capacity-building is a cross-cutting issue, should figure prominently in the 2015 agreement and should be country-driven. Many developing countries said capacity-building should focus on both mitigation and adaptation.</p>
<p>Pakistan, for the LMDCs, the Dominican Republic, and Nepal, for the LDCs, stressed the need for support for capacity-building. St. Kitts and Nevis, for AOSIS, China and the Republic of Korea called for a capacity-building window under the Convention’s financial mechanism. The EU emphasized the role of the private sector, especially in terms of technology.</p>
<p>On institutional arrangements, the EU and Japan suggested strengthening the Durban Forum on Capacity-building. South Africa said the Durban Forum has not had the opportunity “to prove itself.” Indonesia stressed the role of the Forum’s national focal points. The US called for encouraging existing bodies under the Convention that carry out capacity-building. Algeria stressed that these bodies should be provided with adequate support. The Republic of Korea and Japan proposed mainstreaming capacity-building in all aspects of the 2015 agreement.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, supported by China and Swaziland, for the African Group, urged building countries’ capacity to identify their capacity-building needs, and called for a working group on capacity-building. AOSIS stressed the need for a stand-alone body. The LDCs, AOSIS, South Africa, Cuba and others called for MRV of the delivery of capacity-building. The EU and the US highlighted their reporting on capacity-building activities. Colombia called for “an innovative look” to identify the recipients and multipliers of capacity-building. The US underscored the need for developing countries to build enabling environments.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> During open-ended consultations on Friday, 15 November, many parties highlighted transparency of actions and support, emphasizing the need for more work on MRV of support. Swaziland, for the African Group, stressed the need for improved transparency in finance, technology and capacity-building commitments through clarifying specific amounts, timelines and sources. Saint Lucia called for: a robust and transparent MRV system built on lessons learned from fast-start finance; indicators to assess the impact of support; standardized format for reporting by developed countries; and simplification of reporting by developing countries. The US highlighted that transparency can enhance the provision of support, and emphasized the need for equal transparency rules for providers and receivers.</p>
<p>The LMDCs highlighted developed and developing countries’ differentiated responsibilities with respect to commitments and reporting, warning that attempts to develop common accounting rules applicable to all would delay action and progress. The African Group, supported by Algeria, cautioned against overburdening developing countries, and against equal obligations for Annex I and non-Annex I parties.</p>
<p>Calling for a common transparency and accountability framework for both up-front information on commitments and <em>ex post</em> MRV, Australia clarified that the intention is not to have the same rules apply to all parties under all circumstances or create unreasonable burdens.</p>
<p>On transparency of mitigation commitments, the US proposed a staged approach to maximize participation, with: all parties submitting nationally determined mitigation commitments under a single but flexible set of rules applicable to all; a global consultation process; and regular reviews at the implementation stage.</p>
<p>Regarding up-front information requirements when establishing mitigation commitments, the EU recognized the need for flexibility, while calling for information on: targets and target periods; sectors and GHGs covered; methodologies used; approaches to market mechanisms; and the accounting system for the land-use sector.</p>
<p>Regarding MRV for developed country mitigation, Nepal, for the LDCs, supported by China, called for accurate, complete and regular reviews, and stressed the need to avoid lowering the standards of the MRV and compliance system of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p><strong>WORKSTREAM 2: The Way Forward:</strong> During open-ended consultations on Wednesday, 13 November, parties were invited to focus on a workstream 2 outcome and concrete actions to raise ambition. The Secretariat presented a technical paper on mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives and options to enhance ambition (FCCC/TP/2013/8 and Add.1&amp;2).</p>
<p>Nauru, for AOSIS, proposed a process focused on renewable energy and energy efficiency involving submissions, technical papers and expert workshops. Nepal, for the LDCs, called for implementation of pledges, expanding their scope and tightening the rules, and stressed means of implementation as essential to workstream 2.</p>
<p>Malaysia, for the G-77/China, said enhanced Annex I commitments should be the first step and called for, <em>inter alia</em>, ratifying the Doha Amendment, and establishing a mechanism matching mitigation and adaptation proposals with finance and technology. China called for: an outcome that recognizes elements beyond mitigation; and work programmes on the adequacy of financial support and IPRs.</p>
<p>The EU suggested: further technical work to draw on the experience of other bodies and further workshops; opportunities for ministers to show leadership; and promoting the UNFCCC’s catalytic role.</p>
<p>On hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), India and Saudi Arabia underlined they “belong” under the UNFCCC. The EU emphasized shared responsibility with the Montreal Protocol. China said the UNFCCC principles should apply to the phase-out of HFCs. Mexico underscored the health co-benefits of addressing short-lived climate pollutants.</p>
<p>Colombia, for AILAC, noted the need for emissions to peak in 2015, calling for, <em>inter alia</em>, increased ambition on REDD+ and a ministerial session in June 2014.</p>
<p>Ecuador stressed that progressing to close the pre-2020 ambition gap is a starting point for moving forward under workstream 1.</p>
<p>Venezuela, for LMDCs, supported by Kuwait and Algeria, called for, <em>inter alia</em>: clarity on finance and support for identifying developing countries’ needs; addressing economic and social consequences from the implementation of response measures; and rapid capitalization and operationalization of the GCF.</p>
<p>South Africa, the Federated States of Micronesia and Bolivia underlined the mitigation, implementation, finance and technology gap. Cameroon, for the Central African Forest Commission (COMIFAC), highlighted the role of reducing, halting and reversing deforestation in closing the mitigation gap. South Africa stressed the need for increased means of implementation for non-Annex I countries. Mali called for building on the US$100 billion goal, with South Africa proposing a portal to match funding with required support.</p>
<p>The US, supported by Canada and Australia, called for harnessing the mitigation potential of sub-national actors. China said these local efforts fall under national action.</p>
<p><strong>Workshop on Lessons Learned from Relevant Experience of Other Multilateral Environmental Agreements:</strong> This workshop took place on Wednesday, 13 November. Delegates were invited to identify concrete arrangements to enhance pre-2020 ambition under workstream 2. Parties addressed:</p>
<p>•  enabling parties to opt out of new obligations;</p>
<p>•  relationship between UNEP and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Secretariat;</p>

<p><strong>Workshop on Urbanization and the Role of Governments in Facilitating Climate Action in Cities:</strong> This workshop took place on Thursday, 14 November. Delegates were invited to chart concrete options for the ADP’s work. Participants addressed: successful policies promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy in transport and buildings; the financing gap in infrastructure needs of developing countries; and the role of non-state actors in the ADP process. For a complete summary of the workshop, see: <a href="/vol12/enb12587e.html">http://enb.iisd.org/vol12/enb12587e.html</a></p>
<p><strong>IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL THE ELEMENTS UNDER BOTH WORKSTREAMS:</strong> During the second week, the ADP’s work continued, based on the Co-Chairs’ draft decision and conclusions, in open-ended informal consultations on implementation of all the elements of Decision 1/CP.17, in a Co-Chairs’ special event, and during a high-level ministerial dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>ADP Co-Chairs’ Special Event:</strong> Participants at the ADP Co-Chairs’ special event on Tuesday, 19 November, focused on: how the 2015 agreement could foster enhanced collaboration between non-state actors and governments; and the role the UNFCCC could play in recognizing and strengthening non-state actors’ initiatives and actions. For more details, see: <a href="/vol12/enb12591e.html">http://enb.iisd.org/vol12/enb12591e.html</a></p>
<p><strong>High-level Ministerial Dialogue on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action:</strong> On Thursday, 21 November, COP 19 President Korolec invited Ministers and other heads of delegations to discuss their views on pre-2020 actions for transitioning to a post-2020 world; and elements required for a successful, meaningful, durable 2015 agreement. For more details, see: <a href="/vol12/enb12593e.html">http://enb.iisd.org/vol12/enb12593e.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Negotiations on progress on the implementation of all elements under both workstreams:</strong> On Monday, 18 November, the ADP Co-Chairs presented draft text on the implementation of all the elements of Decision 1/CP.17, consisting of: draft Co-Chairs’ conclusions; and a draft decision on pre-2020 ambition and post-2020 action, including an annex with indicative elements of the 2015 agreement. Parties discussed several revised versions throughout the week. The closing ADP plenary, which was originally scheduled for Thursday afternoon, was continually postponed as negotiations continued in the open-ended consultations, as well as informally all day and night on Friday, and on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Areas of disagreement included: incorporating “indicative elements of the 2015 agreement” or a “non-exhaustive list of areas for further reflection” as an annex to the decision or conclusions, respectively, which were rejected by many for lack of negotiation time; and the issue of “nature and extent of differentiation.” Discussions were polarized between various developing countries, which stressed continued application of the principles, provisions and annex-based differentiation arrangement under the Convention; and developed countries, which emphasized the need to continue but also update the application of the CBDR principle to reflect evolving circumstances. In addition, delegates differed on, <em>inter alia</em>: a clear roadmap for finance and technology transfer; loss and damage; MRV for support; a timeline to submit intended nationally determined commitments, and accompanying information for assessment against adequacy and fairness; a compliance mechanism; accounting rules; and IPRs.</p>
<p> India expressed concern that the text “presumes” that in the 2015 agreement each party will have commitments on mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building.</p>
<p>China emphasized the need to enhance implementation up to 2020 and the Bali Action Plan (BAP). The LDCs called for reference to the principles of equity and fairness, and confidence building through full implementation of the BAP.</p>
<p>On a roadmap for finance, the US stressed that the US$100 billion target was made in the context of a wide package of decisions and that new commitments “cannot be made along the way.” The LMDCs opposed proposals related to harnessing private investment for mitigation.</p>
<p>On increasing ambition, the EU called for a workplan with deadlines, up-front transparency and an assessment phase under workstream 1, and concrete actions under workstream 2. He also stressed inclusion of the 2˚C goal. India underscored the need to: increase developed countries’ mitigation ambition to at least 40% below 1990 levels; enhance technology transfer; and address IPRs. Australia, Japan and Canada opposed reference to IPRs.</p>
<p>Singapore said collaborative work at the sub-national level should be in the context of sharing and learning. The US, Japan and Canada supported facilitating collaborative work on mitigation and adaptation at the sub-national level. The LMDCs cautioned against referring to actions outside the Convention.</p>
<p><strong>CLOSING PLENARY:</strong> ADP Co-Chair Kumarsingh opened the closing ADP plenary Saturday afternoon, 23 November at 12:12 pm, two days later than originally scheduled. Reflecting on inclusive, transparent, interactive and candid ADP consultations, he invited parties to consider for adoption draft conclusions containing a non-exhaustive list of areas for further reflection, and a draft decision on further advancing the Durban Platform (FCCC/ADP/2013/L.4 &amp; Add.1). He stressed the text as party driven and sensitive to a diversity of views, noting that it does not prejudge the content for the 2015 agreement.</p>
<p> India, for Brazil, South Africa, India and China (BASIC), supported by China, Saudi Arabia, and Singapore, lamented that the text lacks urgency, ambition and a clear roadmap on finance. He stressed balance in the decision requires that a reference to “all parties” with the term “commitments” requires adding the context “in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.” He opposed the annex in the conclusions for lack of proper discussion of its listed areas.</p>
<p>Stressing differentiation should remain valid and calling for referring to “enhanced actions” when speaking of developing countries and “commitments” when referring to developed countries, China, with the Philippines, called for a reference to Article 4 of the Convention (differentiation of commitments). He stressed that the purpose of the ADP is not to create a new climate regime, but to enhance the full and effective implementation of the Convention, requiring means of implementation and transparency of actions and support. He described the annex as “unbalanced, very selective and misleading.”</p>
<p> Singapore suggested moving the annex into a Co-Chairs’ reflection note and stressed that past commitments have not been fulfilled. The US, with the EU, supported the draft decision and conclusions with the annex, and opposed a reference to Article 4 of the Convention, noting diverging views on how differentiation should be captured in the new agreement.</p>
<p>Noting it “has been a very long week and night” and that it “is becoming a long day,” Fiji, for the G-77/China, thanked all parties for their involvement in discussions on the ADP in 2013 and expressed desire to see agreement in 2015. Nauru, for AOSIS, said the decision provides an opportunity to unlock mitigation potential to limit global warming below 1.5˚C, and stressed parties should “go home, do their homework, and bring options for decisive action” at key events next year. The Gambia, for the LDCs, emphasized that it views the text in the “spirit of compromise” and had not raised issues “dear” to the Group despite concerns on: adequacy, science and NAPAs; lack of reflection of different capabilities; and insufficient reference to finance and implementation.</p>
<p>Expressing preparedness to accept the text, Colombia, for AILAC, called for acting within the framework of respective capacities and taking into account priorities of all parties. She said success in Lima and Paris requires more balanced discussions and thinking about “how we are working.”</p>
<p> Bolivia noted it had originally proposed adding reference to Article 4 of the Convention (commitments), and stressed that text referring to commitments from developing countries by 2015 implies a challenge that can only be met through compliance with Article 4 of the Convention, including clarity on provision of finance.</p>
<p> Proposing submitting the text for adoption to the COP, the Russian Federation said other COP/CMP decisions should not be held “hostage” because of the lack of agreement on the ADP draft text.</p>
<p> Noting physical strain from lack of sleep and the urgency to reach agreement, Venezuela, Swaziland, for the African Group, and Switzerland asked the ADP Co-Chairs to inform delegates of the timeline of the meeting.</p>
<p> Co-Chair Kumarsingh suspended the ADP closing plenary at 2:16 pm for parties to seek an agreement and resumed the closing plenary at 3:40 pm. India read out the proposed amendments resulting from “the informal huddle.” In the draft decision, the proposal was to replace the term “commitments” with “contributions, without prejudice to the legal nature of the contributions,” and substituting the wording “parties in a position to do so” with “parties ready to do so.” In the draft conclusions, the proposal was to delete the non-exhaustive list of areas for further reflection contained in the annex, as well as reference to the annex contained in the draft conclusions. Prior to the ADP’s adoption of the conclusions and draft decision on further advancing the Durban Platform (FCCC/ADP/2013/L.4 &amp; Add.1), as orally amended, Bolivia and Cuba stated their understanding that the amended paragraph in the decision should be applied in strict conformity to Article 4 and, in particular Article 4.7, of the Convention.</p>
<p> The ADP adopted its report (FCCC/ADP/2013/L.3). Co-Chair Kumarsingh acknowledged delegates’ diligent work to arrive at a substantive outcome, and Co-Chair Runge-Metzger, also referring to delegates, said “what would we be without them – and what would they be without us?” Co-Chair Kumarsingh suspended ADP 2-3 at 4:08 pm. The COP later adopted the ADP conclusions and decision, and took note of the ADP report.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome:</em></strong>In its conclusions (FCCC/ADP/2013/L.4), the ADP invites parties and admitted observer organizations to submit information on opportunities for actions with high mitigation potential, including their mitigation benefits, costs, co-benefits and barriers to their implementation, and strategies to overcome those barriers, including finance, technology and capacity-building support for mitigation action in developing countries. The ADP also requests the Secretariat to, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p>•  organize in-session workshops;</p>
<p>•  enhance the visibility on the UNFCCC website of quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets, quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments and nationally appropriate mitigation actions, as well as of actions with high mitigation potential, including actions of public and private entities with adaptation and sustainable development co-benefits;</p>
<p>•  organize technical expert meetings in 2014 to share policies, practices and technologies and address the necessary finance, technology and capacity-building, with a special focus on actions with high mitigation potential with the participation of parties, civil society, the private sector and cities and other subnational authorities;</p>
<p>•  prepare regular updates on actions with high mitigation potential; and</p>
<p>•  convene a forum to share experiences and best practices of cities and subnational authorities in relation to adaptation and mitigation.</p>
<p>In its decision (FCCC/ADP/2013/L.4/Add.1), the COP:</p>
<p>•  warns that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies, future generations and the planet;</p>
<p>•  underlines the significant gap between the aggregate effect of parties’ mitigation pledges and aggregate emission pathways consistent with having a likely chance of holding the increase in global average temperature below 2°C or 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels;</p>
<p>•  affirms that fulfilling the ultimate objective of the Convention will require strengthening the multilateral, rules-based regime and the urgent and sustained implementation of existing commitments under the Convention;</p>
<p>•  urges all parties to the Kyoto Protocol to ratify and implement the Doha Amendment;</p>
<p>•  emphasizes that enhanced action and international cooperation on adaptation are urgently required to enable and support the implementation of adaptation actions aimed at reducing vulnerability and building resilience in developing countries;</p>
<p>•  requests the ADP to further elaborate elements for a draft negotiating text, taking into consideration its work, including, <em>inter alia</em>, on mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building, and transparency of action and support;</p>
<p>•  invites all parties to initiate or intensify domestic preparations for their intended nationally determined contributions, without prejudice to the legal nature of the contributions, in the context of adopting a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all parties towards achieving the objective of the Convention and to communicate them well in advance of COP 21 (by the first quarter of 2015 by those parties ready to do so), without prejudging the legal nature of the contributions;</p>
<p>•  requests the ADP to identify, by COP 20, the information that parties will provide when putting forward their contributions, without prejudice to the legal nature of the contributions;</p>
<p>•  urges and requests developed country parties, the operating entities of the financial mechanism and any other organizations in a position to do so to provide support for the related activities as early as possible in 2014;</p>
<p>•  resolves to accelerate the full implementation of the BAP, in particular in relation to the provision of means of implementation, recognizing that such implementation will enhance ambition in the pre-2020 period;</p>
<p>•  resolves to enhance ambition in the pre-2020 period in order to ensure the highest possible mitigation efforts under the Convention by all parties; and</p>
<p>•  decides to accelerate activities under the workplan on enhancing mitigation ambition.</p>

<p><strong>ADAPTATION COMMITTEE’S REPORT:</strong> These joint SBI/SBSTA discussions are summarized under the SBI agenda item on the Adaptation Committee’s report (see page 17).</p>
<p><strong>METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE FOR REDD+:</strong> This issue was first addressed in the SBSTA plenary on 11 November. Chair Muyungi recalled that SBSTA 38 had recommended the adoption of three draft COP decisions (FCCC/SBSTA/2013/L.12/Add.1, 2 &amp; 3) on: the timing and the frequency of presentations of the summary of information on how all safeguards are being addressed and respected; modalities for national forest monitoring systems; and the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation. SBSTA 38 had also prepared elements of two draft COP decisions (FCCC/SBSTA/2013/L.12) on MRV modalities; and guidelines and procedures for the technical assessment of submissions from parties on proposed forest reference emission levels and/or forest reference levels. These issues were further discussed in a contact group co-chaired by Peter Graham (Canada) and Robert Kofi Bamfo (Ghana).</p>
<p>On Saturday, 16 November, the SBSTA adopted conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2013/L.33); and two draft COP decisions (FCCC/SBSTA/2013/L.33/Add.1 &amp; Add.2) on MRV modalities; and guidelines and procedures for the technical assessment of submissions from parties on proposed forest reference emission levels and/or forest reference levels.</p>
<p>On 22 November the COP plenary adopted all decisions. The Philippines, supported by Australia, for the Umbrella Group, Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico, for Environmental Integrity Group, and the EU, highlighted: that the reference to “livelihoods” in the decision on the drivers of deforestation should not be interpreted so as to mean that indigenous peoples are the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation; and that when addressing the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation traditional livelihoods of indigenous peoples should not be negatively affected. President Korolec invited delegates to adopt the decision with the understanding suggested by the Philippines and supported by others. He said all decisions on REDD+ adopted at COP 19, including those on finance and institutional arrangements, will be called the “Warsaw REDD+ Framework.”</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome:</em></strong> On modalities for national forest monitoring systems (FCCC/SBSTA/2013/L.12/Add.1) the COP, <em>inter alia</em>, decides that:</p>
<p>•  the development of parties’ national forest monitoring systems for the monitoring and reporting of REDD+ activities should take into account the guidance in decision 4/CP.15 and be guided by the most recent IPCC guidance and guidelines; and</p>
<p>•  robust national forest monitoring systems should provide data and information that are transparent, consistent over time, and suitable for MRV anthropogenic forest-related emissions by sources and removals by sinks, forest carbon stocks, and forest carbon stock and forest-area changes resulting from the implementation of REDD+ activities.</p>
<p>On the timing and the frequency of presentations of the summary of information on how safeguards are addressed and respected (FCCC/SBSTA/2013/L.12/Add.2), the COP, <em>inter alia</em>, decides that:</p>
<p>•  developing country parties should start providing the summary of information in their national communication or communication channel, including via the web platform of the UNFCCC, after the start of the implementation of REDD+ activities; and</p>
<p>•  the frequency of subsequent presentations of the summary of information should be consistent with the provisions for submissions of national communications from non-Annex I parties.</p>
<p>On the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation (FCCC/SBSTA/2013/L.12/Add.3), the COP, <em>inter alia</em>, encourages parties, organizations and the private sector to take action to reduce the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, and to continue their work to address the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation and share the results of their work.</p>
<p>On MRV modalities (FCCC/SBSTA/2013/L.33/Add.2), the COP, <em>inter alia</em>, decides that:</p>
<p>•  MRV is to be consistent with guidance provided in decision 4/CP.15;</p>
<p>•  the data and information used by parties in the estimation of anthropogenic forest-related emissions should be transparent, and consistent over time and with the established forest reference emission levels and/or forest reference levels; and</p>
<p>•  data and information should be provided through the biennial update reports by parties.</p>
<p>On forest reference emission levels and/or forest reference levels (FCCC/SBSTA/2013/L.33/Add.1), the COP, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p>•  adopts the guidelines and procedures for the technical assessment of submissions from parties on proposed forest reference emission levels and/or forest reference levels; and</p>
<p>•  requests the Secretariat to prepare a synthesis report on the technical assessment process, for consideration by the SBSTA.</p>

<p><strong>ISSUES RELATED TO AGRICULTURE:</strong> This issue (FCCC/SBSTA/2013/MISC.17, Add.1 and 2) was first discussed on 11 and 13 November in plenary. A workshop on the current state of scientific knowledge on how to enhance the adaptation of agriculture to climate change impacts was held on 12 November, co-facilitated by Hans Åke Nilsagård (Sweden) and Selam Kidane Abebe (Ethiopia). For more details, see <a href="/vol12/enb12585e.html">http://enb.iisd.org/vol12/enb12585e.html</a>.</p>
<p>During the SBSTA opening plenary, SBSTA Chair Muyungi proposed establishing a contact group. Several developing countries opposed this, explaining that parties only agreed to hold a workshop while several developed country parties supported a contact group. On Wednesday, 13 November, Chair Muyungi reported that his informal consultations on whether or not to convene a contact group yielded agreement to consider at SBSTA 40 the Secretariat’s report on the workshop, as well as submissions by parties and observer organizations, and not to convene a contact group. The SBSTA agreed to these conclusions.</p>
<p>On 16 November, the SBSTA adopted conclusions. A group of developed countries expressed concern over the lack of discussions on agriculture and with the way the conclusions were adopted. They called for SBSTA 40 to build on areas of commonality. Other developed countries also expressed regret that no contact group was established and the submissions were not considered at SBSTA 39. Many developing countries supported the way the conclusions were adopted, noting the procedures were correctly applied, and emphasized the role of agriculture in adaptation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Outcome:</em></strong>In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2013/L.35) the SBSTA acknowledges parties exchange of views during the in-session workshop and agrees to consider at SBSTA 40 the report of the in-session workshop and the views submitted by parties and observer organizations.</p>

<p><strong>OTHER MATTERS: Brazilian proposal</strong>: This issue was first taken up on Monday, 11 November, and considered in informal consultations facilitated by SBSTA Chair Muyungi.</p>
<p>During the SBSTA’s consideration of the Brazilian proposal to address the development by the IPCC of a reference methodology on historical responsibilities to guide domestic consultations for the 2015 agreement, the US, supported by the EU, Australia, Switzerland, Canada, New Zealand, Norway and Israel, opposed consideration of this issue, whereas Venezuela, India, Cuba, China, Bolivia and Saudi Arabia supported it. BASIC welcomed the Brazilian proposal.</p>
<p>During the SBSTA plenary on 13 November, the G-77/China endorsed the Brazilian proposal and requested that it be considered in a contact group. Parties continued to consult informally but were unable to reach consensus. The G-77/China, supported by Venezuela, Bolivia, India, Nicaragua, Argentina, Malaysia and the Philippines, lamented that no strong signal will be sent from Warsaw on objective and science-based information on historical responsibilities. Brazil regretted that the IPCC has not been requested to provide this information. </p>
<p>Switzerland highlighted scientific information that includes not only historical contributions, but capacity, as well as current and future emissions. The EU identified the need for domestic consultations on commitments in the 2015 agreement based on a broad range of indicators, including past, current and future emissions, and different capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>CLOSING PLENARY:</strong> SBSTA 39 adopted its report (FCCC/SBSTA/2013/L.21) on Sunday, 17 November. Parties made closing statements and asked for them to be made available on the UNFCCC website. Australia, for Japan, Canada, Australia and the US, noted that SBSTA’s consideration of the joint annual report of the TEC and CTCN was not completed at this session and should be considered at SBSTA 40. Chair Muyungi thanked delegates and closed the meeting at 2:56 am.</p>
<p><strong><em>JOINT COP/CMP CLOSING PLENARY </em></strong></p>
<p>The joint COP/CMP closing plenary took place in the evening of Saturday, 23 November. Referring to running a marathon, COP19 President Korolec expressed satisfaction with having reached the finish line with results “one can be proud of.”</p>
<p>Australia, for the Umbrella Group, thanked the presidency for conducting a party-driven process leading to agreement among all groups building on Durban and Doha.</p>
<p>India highlighted equity as an absolute and inalienable right that “cannot be equated with, and is far beyond, fairness.”</p>
<p>Fiji, for the G-77/China, thanked the COP President for delivering transparency, inclusiveness, solidarity and efficiency, as promised.</p>
<p>Highlighting “good overall progress” in Warsaw, the EU hailed COP 19 as the biggest advance on REDD+ since Cancun, expressing, however, disappointment that outstanding technical questions concerning the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol could not be solved.</p>
<p>Expressing satisfaction with the establishment of the Warsaw international mechanism on loss and damage, Nauru, for AOSIS, lamented that a “catastrophic ambition gap” remains, emphasizing the need to raise the level of finance and calling on the world’s leading experts to join efforts with the AOSIS workstream 2 plan launched under the ADP in Warsaw.</p>
<p>Thanking the President for “maintaining” transparency and welcoming the establishment of the Warsaw international mechanism on loss and damage, Nepal, for the LDCs, lamented lack of progress on, <em>inter alia</em>, LTF and IPRs, and called for an acceleration in negotiations under the ADP.</p>
<p>Swaziland, for the African Group, called on Annex I parties to ratify the Doha Amendment, expressing: disappointment with lack of progress under CMP agenda items 5, 7 and 8, and failure to improve the CDM; and concern over proposal to include the CDM in a new market mechanism.</p>
<p>Expressing satisfaction with the establishment of the Warsaw international mechanism on loss and damage, Panama, for the Central American Integration System (SICA), called for: strengthening developed country parties’ commitments; bridging the gap and increasing ambitions before 2020; and replenishing the GCF.</p>
<p>Lamenting lack of ambition, Mexico emphasized its national efforts irrespective of an international agreement, and the need to take action “without bargaining with the future of our planet.”</p>
<p>Australia informed that its participation in the COP 19 decisions does not indicate acceptance of provisions in paragraph 7 (urging developed countries to maintain and increase public climate finance) in the decision on LTF (FCCC/CP/2013/L.13) and in paragraphs 13-14 (ambitious and timely contributions to enable the operationalization of the GCF, including initial resource mobilization) in the decision on the report of and guidance to the GCF (FCCC/CP/2013/L.12). Canada clarified it understands paragraph 13 of this same decision refers to a collective contribution by developed countries and that countries may also provide finance through other channels. He expressed commitment to the goal of jointly mobilizing, from a wide variety of finance sources, US$100 billion annually by 2020.</p>
<p>Environmental NGOs lamented a weak outcome, insufficient to close the emissions gap and lacking clear agreement on the roadmap to the 2015 agreement. YOUNGOs urged applying the principle of intergenerational equity in the 2015 agreement.</p>
<h2>A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE WARSAW CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE</h2>
<p>“<em>We’re on a road to nowhere</em></p>
<p><em>Come on inside”</em></p>
<p><em> - </em>Talking Heads</p>
<p>Last year, Typhoon Bopha ravaged the Philippines during the Doha Climate Change Conference, prompting the Philippines’ Naderev Saño to ask “If not us, then who? If not now, then when? If not here, then where?” A year later, the Warsaw Climate Change Conference opened as Supertyphoon Haiyan, the strongest storm to ever make landfall, ravaged the Philippines yet again and Saño chose actions over words, undertaking a voluntary fast, joined by over 200 supporters, until a meaningful outcome was reached in Warsaw. The fast, the supertyphoon, and the many marches and protests, became touchstones of the urgency of climate action, backed by alarms sounded by the scientific community leading up to COP 19.</p>
<p>Heading into Warsaw, the scientific community issued a “clarion call” that climate change is unequivocal and its effects are evident in many parts of the world, including flooding in the Middle East and Europe, and prolonged droughts in the US and Australia. Two months before the COP, IPCC Working Group I concluded that human influence on the climate system is clear and limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of GHG emissions. The World Meteorological Organization confirmed that 2013 has been among the top ten warmest years on record and that melting ice caps and glaciers, in part, brought global sea level to a new record high.</p>
<p>While these reports outlined the already-evident effects of climate change, others showed how paltry the international response currently is. The UNEP Emissions Gap Report showed an increase in emissions in 2013, noting that the opportunities for reaching the 2°C goal are closing and warning against the costs of inaction.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop of urgency—for ambitious mitigation, earnest adaptation, and resolute efforts on loss and damage—COP 19 convened in Warsaw. In striking contrast to reality on the ground and in the atmosphere, a sense of resolve was notably absent at the Warsaw National Stadium, the venue for the conference. Halfway along the road between Durban and Paris, this brief analysis takes stock of the COP’s ability to fulfill expectations, the ADP’s progress towards a 2015 agreement and enhancing pre-2020 ambition, and the UNFCCC’s ability as a process to respond to the grave challenge posed by the changing climate.</p>
<p><strong><em>MODEST EXPECTATIONS FOR A STOP ALONG THE ROAD </em></strong></p>
<p>Before the opening of the conference, many expected Warsaw to be a “Finance COP,” or an “Implementation COP.” Yet, by the end of the meeting, those wondering if COP 19 could be a “REDD+ COP” were ultimately proven correct. Parties approved a package of decisions, heralded by many as an overdue success, creating the Warsaw Framework for REDD+ that addresses a series of methodological questions, institutional arrangements and results-based finance. COP 19 also reached relatively timid decisions on some issues, such as long-term finance, and loss and damage.</p>
<p>At COP 19, financial issues proved thorny, ultimately tied to diminishing trust among parties in the climate process. Pledges made in Warsaw, including US$40 million by the Republic of Korea to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and US$72.5 million by seven European governments to the Adaptation Fund, were insufficient to build confidence among developing countries that the 2009 promise of US$100 billion per year by 2020 would be realized. Developing countries point to the fact that climate finance pledged through multilateral funds decreased by 71% in the last year, and the GCF contains only US$6.9 million donated by only ten countries. With the GCF in large part still an “empty shell,” many developing countries worried that pledges would not materialize into actual deposits to realize the 2020 goal. Thus far, developed countries have explained that their finance ministers are leery of sending funds to an institution lacking finalized operating procedures. In Warsaw, with the operationalization of the GCF, several developed countries expressed willingness to pledge, yet the pledges did not necessarily raise developing countries’ confidence that the funds will actually materialize.</p>
<p>Another key COP 19 agenda item, loss and damage, was also unable to restore developing countries’ confidence that the UNFCCC process can meet their expectations. Last year in Doha, it was agreed that COP 19 would establish “institutional arrangements, such as an international mechanism,” to address loss and damage in countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, and elaborate its functions and modalities in accordance with the role of the Convention. This issue proved to be one of the most contentious of the conference.</p>
<p>Loss and damage results from slow onset or extreme weather events that cannot be prevented by even the most ambitious mitigation action. Due to the extreme, and sometimes permanent, nature of the damage and losses involved, loss and damage cannot be adequately addressed through adaptation either. For developing countries, particularly members of AOSIS and the African Group, it was therefore crucial that the mechanism’s specific functions and modalities include provision of support and that funding for actions on loss and damage come from a dedicated source separate from adaptation finance. Conversely, developed countries repeatedly emphasized that, as part of the Cancun Adaptation Framework, arrangements on loss and damage should not duplicate or add layers to the existing institutional framework.</p>
<p>In the end, agreement was only reached during the closing plenary, with the G-77/China squeezing in last-minute amendments in a final attempt to distinguish loss and damage from adaptation, even if only in the preamble. Building to a large extent on the Doha decision, the new Warsaw international mechanism provides for enhancing knowledge, action and support for loss and damage, as well as strengthening dialogue among relevant stakeholders. Yet it merely “requests” developed countries to provide developing countries with financial support. Provisions on the 2016 review of the mechanism’s structure, mandate and effectiveness came as a last-ditch effort by developing countries to get a better deal; however, with three more years to go before the review could potentially strengthen the mechanism, it could be a case of too little, too late for those already suffering from climate change-related loss and damage.   </p>
<p>While parties found minimal agreement on finance and loss and damage, they were unable to achieve consensus on other key issues, including markets, agriculture, response measures, and Articles 5, 7 and 8 (methodological issues under Protocol). A standout among these issues was work related to non-market-based approaches, the new market mechanism and the framework for various approaches, which seek to elaborate common rules for all mitigation efforts, market and non-market based, to ensure environmental integrity. COP 19 inherited the politically difficult issues of markets from the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action. Developed countries point to the need for a variety of tools, such as market mechanisms, to “stretch” their ambition. Developing countries, however, have a fundamentally different view, pointing to sputtering carbon markets and low prices for carbon credits as proof of the need for greater mitigation ambition. Despite the COP President’s attempt to intercede during the second week and find a way forward on the issue, parties could not reach agreement, finally forwarding this highly political issue to its technical body to address next year.</p>
<p>Amid what many called “mixed” or “disappointing” results, REDD+ stood out as perhaps a singular achievement. After eight years of negotiations, and extra time allotted to negotiate technical REDD+ issues in June, parties finally completed a package agreement. Still, institutional arrangements and finance proved difficult. Both institutional and financial issues had to contend with the myriad of REDD+ initiatives and projects currently underway outside the UNFCCC process. While negotiators worked for years to secure common MRV guidance and financial arrangements, a multitude of bilateral and multilateral, public and private initiatives sprung up. Various parties and other stakeholders were already invested with a particular set of arrangements and unwilling to shift midway through their REDD+ process, which weakened the decisions on REDD+ institutional arrangements and finance. The institutional arrangements decision amounts to annual meetings between national focal points and funding agencies. The decision on finance creates yet another REDD+ information hub. It falls short of establishing the market mechanism envisioned by those who brought deforestation back to the UNFCCC agenda in 2005. Instead, it leans toward a fund-based approach, which could, by some estimates, require US$30 billion annually.</p>
<p>Aside from the relative success of the REDD+ package, COP 19 really did not even meet its modest expectations. For some, solely meeting the bare minimum was a further sign of increasingly diminishing confidence in the process, as issues of trust among parties led to sober reflections on the process itself.</p>
<p><strong><em>CONDUCTING A PROCEDURAL DIAGNOSTIC: GREASING A SQUEAKING WHEEL </em></strong></p>
<p>Since Copenhagen, concerns over transparency and process have cast a shadow over the UNFCCC. The need to rebuild both trust among parties and legitimacy of the process is dire. To some extent, more transparent and inclusive talks in Cancun and the Durban “indabas” did manage to restore a certain degree of confidence. Yet, acrimonious discussions returned again in Warsaw as the fragile feeling of trust dissipated. Developing countries complained of “broken promises” and made desperate calls for implementing agreed commitments on finance, while mutual accusations of backtracking were thrown around. Some controversial statements made during a press conference sparked a finger-pointing session between the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDCs) and the EU, which some even described as “negotiating through the media.” With trust issues like these, the road to Paris is likely to be a bumpy one.    </p>
<p>Procedural trepidations, too, never truly left the process. In Cancun, COP President Patricia Espinosa gaveled through the adoption of the Cancun Agreements despite Bolivia’s opposition, leaving many to ponder the meaning of consensus. Just two years later, COP President Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah gaveled through the adoption of the Doha Amendment notwithstanding Russia’s raised flag. This caused Russia to demand that decision-making be put on the SBI agenda, which resulted in a procedural impasse last June when the SBI was unable to begin its work for two weeks. Following protracted consultations immediately prior to the Warsaw conference, a new agenda item on decision-making in the UNFCCC was introduced under the COP, and informal open-ended consultations were launched. In these informal consultations, parties considered procedural issues that will shape their future discussions.</p>
<p>Although no formal outcome in the form of a COP decision was reached, the creation of a designated window for procedural discussions is significant. Parties appeared to be on the same wavelength on the timeliness of addressing the decision-making process perceived as flawed by many, and “cleaning house” before Paris. The task seems daunting, however, as numerous issues have been added to a laundry list dominated by an overarching concern over legitimacy of the process.</p>
<p>Anxieties surrounding transparency and inclusiveness versus efficiency and effectiveness; the roles of the COP President, the Secretariat and presiding officers; organization of high-level engagement as well as the process for achieving outcomes—all harking back to Copenhagen—have been haunting the UNFCCC process for years. And although COP President Marcin Korolec was hailed for conducting the process in a transparent and party-driven manner, many developing countries’ delegations were spread too thinly to be able to effectively follow the packed agenda. Late nights, too, continued to compromise transparency, efficiency and inclusiveness, which led some to wonder if all-night negotiations could be some parties’ tactic, and to question their good faith.</p>
<p>The avoidance of package deals, too, engendered discussions. With the adoption of the rules of procedure nowhere in sight, package deals have, in the past, been the means to reach consensus. Yet, package deals often mean that parties are forced to accept compromises on issues that, if taken on their own, they would not agree to. During the informal stocktaking plenary on Saturday morning, COP President Korolec slipped up to mention “a package,” an eyebrow-raising comment he later retracted after the G-77/China and others sought reassurance that each decision would be considered on its face value. Other parties, however, seemed more comfortable with package-deal language. The outcomes of several COPs leading up to Warsaw have been the result of take-it-or-leave-it, not give-and-take, deals. Warsaw prudently showed caution on that front.</p>
<p><strong><em>ADP: HALFWAY STOP ON THE ROAD TO NOWHERE? </em></strong></p>
<p>The main expectation for the ADP at COP 19 was to intensify work on the content of the 2015 agreement and on concrete outcomes on pre-2020 ambition, thereby instilling confidence that this process can deliver on both fronts. Despite the best efforts of the Co-Chairs, results were sparse.</p>
<p>The task to “develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all parties” by 2015 to enter into force by 2020, agreed in Durban, has become a touchstone of the UNFCCC’s ability to respond to the urgency of climate change. Progress toward a new agreement is one indication of whether the UNFCCC is still relevant and able to take the necessary action to combat climate change.</p>
<p>At the halfway mark to 2015, with just two years to go, parties seem far from delivering on their goal to complete a negotiating text at COP 20 in Lima.</p>
<p>It appears that the 2015 agreement is developing into a purely “bottom-up” arrangement, meaning that states delineate the extent and nature of their contributions. What seems to be lacking is top-down commitments and a pledge-and-review mechanism to assess the patchwork of national contributions to determine if they represent emission reductions substantial enough to stay within the 2°C target. The controversial reference to “intended nationally determined contributions” that would not prejudge their legal nature was introduced as an oral amendment in the final minutes of the ADP closing plenary.  The term “contributions,” as opposed to “commitments,” represented a divide between developed countries and some developing countries, particularly the LMDCs. This effectively left fundamental issues, such as the legal nature of the 2015 agreement and the means to differentiate commitments in an agreement “applicable to all,” unresolved.</p>
<p>Differentiation is also side-stepped in the decision. Many developed and several developing countries supported a discussion on how differentiation could be reflected in the 2015 agreement, which, according to the Durban mandate, should be “applicable to all.” However, LMDCs are hesitant to revisit this issue and argue instead for any future agreement to reflect the Annex I/non-Annex I distinction. Developing countries supporting discussions on differentiation, such as AILAC, felt their voices were drowned out by the rising visibility of the LMDCs as well as the acrimony between the EU and Venezuela, which became a distraction during the final days.</p>
<p>Revising differentiation in the 2015 agreement is a key demand of developed countries. Given fundamental changes in the global economy since 1992, some non-Annex I countries, such as the Republic of Korea, China, Brazil and India, are now economic powerhouses with associated increases in GHG emissions. For a long time, their argument for retaining Annex I/non-Annex I differentiation was rooted in their per capita emissions being much lower than those in developed countries and their right to sustainable development. Today, China, the world’s largest emitter in absolute terms, also ranks on par with the EU in per capita terms, prompting those open to differentiation to note the need for the 2015 agreement to look at current and future emissions as those will amount to tomorrow’s historical responsibilities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, several developed countries, currently holding the historical responsibilities for atmospheric concentrations of GHGs, have yet to embrace their leadership role, as evidenced by the gap between the slim pledges and implementation of commitments, and the cuts needed to keep global temperature rise below 2°C.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, pre-2020 mitigation ambition has been slow to emerge. Only four countries—Bangladesh, Barbados, Mauritius and the United Arab Emirates—have ratified the Doha Amendment, which needs 144 ratifications to enter into force. China and the EU did announce their intentions to ratify; however, even with all of the EU member states on board, a further 110 ratifications are needed. Thus, until the Doha Amendment enters into force, parties with quantified emissions limitation or reduction commitments (QELRCs), are not legally bound to fulfill them. Furthermore, the second commitment period covers only about 15% of global emissions, which makes it imperative that other countries contribute to the global mitigation effort if the global temperature goal of 2°C is to be achieved. The COP decision on “Further advancing the Durban Platform” contains no targets for 2020, merely urging states that have not communicated their quantified economy-wide emission reduction target, or nationally appropriate mitigation action, to do so. It further urges developed countries “to implement without delay” their quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets under the Convention, and QELRCs for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, if applicable.</p>
<p>If anything, the Warsaw COP saw pre-2020 mitigation ambition wane. For example, Japan, one of the few Annex I countries without a QELRC for the second commitment period, announced its new GHG emission reduction target during the first week of the COP. It has pledged to reduce its emissions by 3.8% compared to 2005 by 2020, which, if using 1990 as the base year, results in an increase of 3.1%, whereas under the Kyoto Protocol first commitment period, Japan was supposed to reduce its GHG emissions by 6% compared to 1990 levels.</p>
<p>The COP also decided to intensify the technical examination of opportunities with high mitigation potential next year, building on a technical paper briefly considered at COP 19. This, however, is less specific than the AOSIS proposal for a technical process focused initially on renewable energy and energy efficiency, coupled with submissions and high-level engagement on those issues. The decision offers little to developing countries on the enhancement of pre-2020 ambition on provision of support other than to urge developed countries to increase technology, finance and capacity-building support to enable increased mitigation ambition by developing countries.</p>
<p>Under the ADP, the task of COP 19 was to show progress toward a 2015 agreement and enhancing pre-2020 ambition, and provide confidence that the UNFCCC can deliver on a substantial mandate in a very short time. On both these fronts, results appeared inadequate. In the absence of delineated potential elements of the 2015 agreement, one wonders if at this stage, the ADP is any closer to a 2015 agreement. Progress toward increasing pre-2020 ambition seems stunted despite the growing evidence and calls for urgent action. On the road to Lima, and only two years from the deadline for an agreement in Paris, the Warsaw outcomes provide little reason for high hopes.</p>
<p><strong><em>ON THE ROAD TO NOWHERE? </em></strong></p>
<p>Announcing his voluntary fast, Naderev Saño reminded participants of the many criticisms of the UNFCCC process as a “farce [and] an annual carbon-intensive gathering of useless frequent fliers.” But he also tried to instill hope that the process can fulfill its potential to be “the project to save the planet, saving tomorrow, today.” What he did not characterize, and what is increasingly gaining relevance, are the growing number of initiatives, policies and programmes outside the UNFCCC actively addressing climate change. Often, these are borne out of the frustration of subnational jurisdictions and non-state actors with the lack of progress in the UNFCCC. In some cases, governments eager for progress have turned to other international institutions, such as the Montreal Protocol, or taking unilateral measures. Several hundred civil society representatives, even those usually engaged constructively in the negotiations, walked out of COP 19, demonstrating their deep reservations—also felt by others—on the ability of the UNFCCC to deliver.</p>
<p>The problem, however, may not be only the flawed process, but also the absent political will. Even a preeminent functioning process will fail when facing a lack of political will to move forward and find a solution. The UN Secretary-General’s upcoming 2014 UN Climate Summit may be able to inject high-level engagement in the climate change arena lacking since Copenhagen. This engagement may entrench positions, but could also find common ground that is currently elusive, but will be necessary if the UNFCCC is to retain any relevance. Ultimately, the question is if climate change will wait for the UNFCCC. Thus far, the evidence shows the UNFCCC is being left behind.</p>

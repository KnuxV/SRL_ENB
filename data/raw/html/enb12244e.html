THE UNFCCC WORKSHOP ON INNOVATIVE OPTIONS FOR FINANCING THE DEVELOPMENT AND
TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES:<br>
 <br>
27-29 SEPTEMBER 2004</font></b></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) workshop on innovative options
for financing the development and transfer of technologies was held from 27-29
September 2004, in Montreal, Canada. Attended by more than 60 representatives of
governments, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and
the private sector, the workshop sought to create a better understanding of
innovative financing for technology transfer under the Convention. The workshop
also aimed to share experiences and information on good practices for financing
technology transfer, and to catalyze innovate thinking on the issue, as well as
to help narrow any differences that might exist.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The workshop
included sessions focusing on the views and perspectives of the financial
sector, current practices and lessons learned in development finance, and
ongoing initiatives for innovative thinking. It concluded with a session
assessing the workshop's outcomes and possible ways to move forward. The
discussions and outcomes of the workshop will be taken up by the UNFCCC's
Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and its Expert
Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) in December 2004 in Buenos Aires.</font></p>
<p class="HEADLINE25" align="center"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">A BRIEF
HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER</font></b></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Climate change is
considered one of the most serious threats to sustainable development, with
adverse impacts expected on human health, food security, economic activity,
water and other natural resources, and physical infrastructure. Global climate
varies naturally, but scientists agree that rising concentrations of
anthropogenically-emitted greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere are leading
to changes in the climate. Scientific observations on climate change were
brought to policy-makers' attention in the late 1970s. Scientific uncertainty
was high, and debate on whether or how to take action took place throughout the
1980s. By the end of the decade, though, the international community had agreed
that a global framework for action was necessary to stabilize the atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases in order to avoid "dangerous anthropogenic
interference" with the climate system. Gases that were considered important to
control included methane, nitrous oxide and, in particular, carbon dioxide.
Negotiations on the UNFCCC began in 1991, and governments adopted it in June
1992. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, and now has 189 Parties.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER: </font></b><font size="2">Technology transfer is considered
a key element in combating climate change under the UNFCCC. Technology transfer
activities have been on the agenda of every session of the SBSTA and the
Conference of the Parties (COP). UNFCCC Article 4.5, which addresses the need
for technology transfer, states that "developed country Partiesshall take all
practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the
transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound technologies</font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and
know-how to other Parties, particularly developing country Parties, to enable
them to implement the provisions of the Convention," adding that "in this
process, the developed country Parties shall support the development and
enhancement of endogenous capacities and technologies of developing country
Parties."</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At the seventh
Conference of the Parties (COP-7) held in November 2001 in Marrakesh, Morocco,
delegates decided to establish an Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) to
support the work of the SBSTA in advancing the Convention's technology-related
goals. During 2002-2003, the EGTT met several times, adopting a work programme
and providing input and advice to the SBSTA on technology transfer. During that
time, the EGTT considered a variety of issues, focusing in particular on
information dissemination, enabling environments for the transfer of
environmentally-sound technologies, and technology needs assessments. In this
regard, UNFCCC workshops were held on technology information (Beijing, China,
April 2002), needs assessments (Seoul, Republic of Korea, April 2002), and
enabling environments (Ghent, Belgium, April 2003). </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In December 2003,
the nineteenth session of SBSTA approved the EGTT's programme of work for 2004.
The programme included a new request that the EGTT should begin to examine the
matter of innovative financing for the development and transfer of technologies.
SBSTA-19 also asked the UNFCCC Secretariat to organize a workshop on the matter,
and to report back on the findings of the workshop at SBSTA-21 in December 2004.
At its twentieth session in June 2004, SBSTA provided further guidance on how
the workshop should be organized, recommending that it have a practical focus
and that it consider case studies from various stakeholders using a range of
technologies under varying situations and circumstances.</font></p>
<p class="HEADLINE25" align="center"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">REPORT OF
THE WORKSHOP</font></b></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The workshop was
opened on Monday morning, 27 September 2004, by Margaret Martin (Canada), the
Chair of the EGTT and the workshop. Observing that this was the first formal
opportunity under the UNFCCC process to discuss innovative options for financing
technology development and transfer since the topic was added to the EGTT's work
programme in 2003, she indicated that the meeting would focus on practical
matters, including case studies and experiences, good practices and obstacles to
technology transfer. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Janos Pasztor,
Coordinator of the UNFCCC Secretariat's Sustainable Development Programme,
highlighted the transfer of technology as a key component in implementing the
Convention. Noting that technology transfer requires significant financial
assistance but that there had been a decline in official development assistance
in recent years, he observed that it was therefore timely to consider new and
innovative financing options. He explained that this workshop would create a
better understanding of the issue, allowing for an exchange of experiences on
good practices and dialogue with the financial sector. It would also help narrow
any differences and identify possible next steps.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Elmer Holt, Vice
Chair of the Climate Technology Initiative (CTI), outlined the work of CTI,
which was founded by a group of developed countries and the European Commission
in 1995. He explained that CTI aimed to support the UNFCCC's technology
objectives, and was actively involved in promoting public-private sector
partnerships, supporting technology needs assessments under the Convention, and
helping to create enabling environments for the transfer of
environmentally-sound technologies.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Margaret McCuaig-Johnston,
Assistant Deputy Minister of Energy Technology and Programmes, Natural Resources
Canada, gave the keynote address of the opening segment. She observed that this
workshop marked the start of a process designed to build a solid foundation to
support innovative options for financing technology transfer under the UNFCCC.
Highlighting the need for transformative and new technologies, she cautioned
that existing, readily-available technologies should not be overlooked. As an
example, she cited an initiative to promote energy efficient compact fluorescent
light bulbs. She also highlighted the challenges in bringing new technologies to
the market, drawing attention to the role commercial demonstration projects can
play. In this context, she stressed the critical need for international
cooperation and private-sector partnerships. Noting that work on financing
should be considered within the broader context of technology transfer, she
noted the EGTT's excellent work in areas such as technology needs assessments
and the information exchange facilitated by the TT:CLEAR website (<a target="_blank" href="http://ttclear.unfccc.int/"><span style="text-decoration: none">http://ttclear.unfccc.int/</span></a>).</font></p>
<p class="HEADLINE3" align="justify"><b><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">SESSION
ONE: SETTING THE SCENE</font></i></b></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The workshop's
first session, which took place on Monday, was divided into two parts. The first
part, held in the morning and early afternoon, focused on providing background
and context to the issue, with briefings from the UNFCCC Secretariat and a
discussion on participants' expectations for the meeting. The second portion
took place in the afternoon, and involved several presentations offering a
general perspective on the issue from representatives of the financial sector.
This was followed by a panel discussion.</font></p>

<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">PART I –</font></b><font size="2">
<b>BACKGROUND: Presentations from the UNFCCC Secretariat: </b>Wanna
Tanunchaiwatana, Manager of the UNFCCC's Technology Subprogramme, outlined the
workshop's background and context. She noted that many developing countries have
now conducted their technology needs assessments, and that this workshop would
help identify financing options to support these needs. She then asked
developing country representatives to identify their specific technology needs.
Several responded, highlighting areas such as energy efficiency, solar energy,
adaptation, and biomass. Tanunchaiwatana concluded by reviewing relevant
provisions of the Convention and existing financing opportunities. She said the
workshop's outcomes would be considered at SBSTA-21 in December 2004.</font></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Daniele Violetti,
Programme Officer, UNFCCC Secretariat, presented on trends in financial flows
for technology transfer. He noted that financial flows to developing countries
have declined since 1997, but increased again in 2002 and 2003, while foreign
direct investment is expected to increase in 2005. He drew attention to the
limited involvement of the private sector in financing climate-related
technology transfer, and highlighted the need to bridge the gap between
governments and the private sector. Identifying the challenges facing the public
sector, he emphasized the need to provide adequate funding, create favorable
market conditions and raise awareness. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Paul van Aalst,
UNFCCC Consultant, presented the <i>Background Information Paper</i> prepared
for this workshop (<a target="_blank" href="http://ttclear.unfccc.int/ttclear/pdf/Workshops/Canada/Montreal%20background%20paper-edited.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: none">http://ttclear.unfccc.int/ttclear/pdf/Workshops/Canada/Montreal
background paper-edited.pdf</span></a>). He highlighted the key prerequisites
for securing financing, including the need to add value for stakeholders,
demonstrate minimal risk and acceptable returns, offer transparency,
accountability and credibility, and contribute to sustainable development. He
reviewed some general financing characteristics for both mitigation and
adaptation activities, and identified barriers to accessing financing at the
country, sectoral and project levels. He then listed the main sources of
financing, including multilateral and intergovernmental organizations,
country-based instruments, other financing models, deal brokers and market
facilitators. He also noted that additional financing instruments were under
construction, and concluded by outlining some general guidelines for innovative
financing, which he said should take into account wider economic and development
goals, and include an effective policy framework. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">
Discussion on workshop expectations: </font></b><font size="2">Participants<b>
</b>were then asked to comment on their expectations for the workshop. One
speaker said he hoped it would lead to a better understanding of the issue, and
was interested in hearing case studies, new ideas for innovative financing, and
suggestions on next steps. A developing country representative said he did not
have high expectations, as the process of technology transfer under the UNFCCC
had not moved quickly to date. He called for the process to be addressed with
far greater urgency, adding that discussions on the role of the private sector
should not be used as an excuse by industrialized countries for not meeting
their obligations under UNFCCC Article 4.5. An industrialized country
representative said he hoped for a meeting focused on what is possible,
practical and achievable. He looked forward to discussions involving financial
"intermediaries" and the private sector, and noted a need to focus on small and
medium-sized enterprises. One developing country speaker said he anticipated
useful discussions on capacity building and on barriers to technology transfer,
while another expressed an interest in learning where the financial resources
would come from, and what the priorities should be. A speaker from the financial
sector explained that investment decisions by the private sector were based on
an assessment of the likely rate of return.</font></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">PART II –
GENERAL PERSPECTIVE FROM THE FINANCIAL SECTOR: </font></b><font size="2">On
Monday afternoon, the second part of the session began, chaired by EGTT member
Rawleston Moore (Barbados).</font><b><font size="2"> </font></b></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">
Presentations: </font></b><font size="2">George Sorenson, Chair of FE Clean
Energy Group, USA, made a presentation on renewable energy and energy efficiency
strategies. He explained that FE Clean Energy Group is a private equity
investment firm with US$150 million of investment capital, and that it finances
energy efficiency and renewable energy projects worldwide. He indicated that for
projects to receive financing, the following elements must be in place: national
policies that support energy efficiency initiatives; financing "enablers,"
including some financing by local or government institutions; financial
guarantors; and a clear and efficient licensing process for new projects. </font>
</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Charles W.
Donovan, Commercial Manager of Transactions, CAT Alliance Ltd UK, spoke about
private sector perspectives on risk. He reviewed several private sector
financing options with different levels of risk, such as common equity,
preferred equity, "Mezzanine" debt that combines debt and equity, senior debt
that receives priority for repayment, and subordinated debt. He indicated that
private sector financing institutions demand project evaluation that evaluates
risks relating to the exchange rate, political situation, environmental
compliance, technology type, operational activities, construction, counterparty
credit and commodity price. He also provided an overview of the credit risk
management process, including the screening of counterparties, development of
trading limits and transaction limit processes, monitoring and reporting of
financial exposure against limits, testing of exposure to financial losses on
individual transactions, and development of credit-support packages that
facilitate the efficient allocation of credit risk for multiple transactions.
</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Martin Whittaker,
Senior Vice President, Swiss Re Financial Services, spoke about commercializing
his company's commitment to sustainability through innovative financing options.
He outlined two specific projects his company is involved in. The first is the
"Footprint Neutral" initiative being developed in partnership with the Nature
Conservancy, Conservation International, and the UN Development Programme. The
initiative will create a voluntary scheme allowing companies to buy into
projects that will offset their carbon emissions and other environmental
impacts. The second project is a European renewable energy and energy efficiency
equity fund targeting returns of 15-25 percent. The fund will focus on Central
and Eastern Europe with the aim of generating and selling carbon offsets to
boost investment returns. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">
Question-and-answer session: </font></b><font size="2">In the ensuing
discussion, one participant raised concerns that banks were willing to fund a
range of projects, but that in some cases insurers were not willing to provide
the necessary performance guarantees on the investment because of a lack of
certainty on the returns, particularly in terms of the value of the carbon that
might be offset by the project, and the risk involved. Martin Whittaker
responded that insurers did not have the underwriting capacity and expertise in
some areas, but would respond should a critical mass of demand for insurance
develop in a particular area, such as geothermal or wind power. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Several government
representatives asked how governments could support private sector involvement.
George Sorenson replied that governments should ensure greater predictability in
terms of financial returns. For instance, he considered the rules governing
"additionality" under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to
be unhelpful because they provided no clarity on what the final value of the
carbon might be. Whittaker said governments should create an attractive
environment for investment to take place, and could help underwrite and remove
risk where the private sector lacks data or information. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Several
participants noted the different "languages" and concepts being used by
representatives of governments compared with those from the private sector, and
said ongoing contact and communication between the two groups would be extremely
valuable. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">Panel
discussion: </font></b><font size="2">Following the presentations and
question-and-answer session, participants engaged in a panel discussion
involving briefings from five invited speakers. This was followed by an exchange
of views on financing issues.</font></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Raymond Wright,
Group Managing Director for the Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica, spoke on
financing and renewable energy markets in Jamaica. He stressed the need for
government guarantees in financing renewable energy projects, as well as the
need to tackle issues relating to taxation, risk sharing, capital availability,
and legal and policy frameworks. He observed that foreign investment in
renewable energy projects will promote risk sharing and access to international
markets, and will enhance local private sector participation. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christine Woerlen,
Global Environment Facility (GEF), highlighted governments' role in promoting
international financing for technology transfer projects by identifying priority
areas, setting out framework conditions for transactions, shaping the financial
flows, enhancing national capacities, and providing adequate information to
investors.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Kok Seng Yap,
Deputy Director-General of the Malaysian Meteorological Service, said that in
order to support financing for technology transfer, countries should disseminate
information on their successes and enhance capacity building for project
implementation. He urged workshop participants to take into consideration the
technology needs assessments conducted in many countries and to identify ways to
meet these needs. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alan Miller,
International Finance Corporation, spoke on financing technology transfer
through commercial lending. He noted obstacles to commercial lending for
technology transfer, including unacceptable investment risks, significant policy
barriers, low or no returns on the investment, and excessive transaction costs.
</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eric Usher, United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), considered three major areas he said
needed to be enhanced in order to promote financing for technology transfer:
information transfer; networks among financial institutions, investors, and
countries in need of technologies; and partnerships among the various actors
involved in financing transactions. He recommended that national governments
improve the enabling environment so as to attract financing. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Following the
panel presentations, a number of participants responded with comments and
questions. A civil society speaker briefed participants on a technology transfer
workshop held recently in Tokyo attended by government officials and industry
representatives. He noted comments during the meeting that competition is
critical, citing as an example the popularity of the Toyota Prius hybrid car in
encouraging other automakers to enter the hybrid car market. He also highlighted
the issue of intellectual property rights, noting that opportunities for
technological leapfrogging were being hampered by concerns over loss of profits
if these rights were given away. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the issue of
project financing, one participant stressed that it was available for "good"
projects, but that most projects were seen as "bad" by the international finance
sector because those in developing countries who were submitting project
proposals did not have sufficient experience in document preparation, and did
not "speak the language of the financial institutions." </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">OVERVIEW
OF DAY ONE: </font></b><font size="2">On Tuesday morning, participants heard an
overview of the first day's presentations and discussions. Workshop Chair
Margaret Martin noted participants' expectations that the workshop should share
information on case studies, good practices, and barriers to financing. She
acknowledged some disappointment in progress on technology transfer to date, as
well as the need to provide enabling environments and reduce investment risk.
She drew attention to comments about adaptation activities and the view that
adaptation and mitigation activities are not mutually exclusive. She noted
speeches emphasizing that insurance companies are paying greater attention to
climate change as a result of increased risk, while observing that not all risks
are quantifiable. She also highlighted comments that environmentally-sound
technologies should be in the public domain, and that a lot of "good" money is
available but that there are more "bad" or poorly-prepared projects than "good"
ones. Finally, she noted discussions on the need for a policy framework that is
"loud, long and legal," meaning that governments provide clear signals to the
market that the renewable energy sector is supported by stable, effective and
transparent rules that encourage investment.</font></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">EGTT member
Rawleston Moore, who had chaired the afternoon portion of the day's discussions,
added his reflections on the session. He highlighted participants' comments on
the importance of mobilizing domestic capital, the value of foreign investment,
the need to overcome the barrier of inadequate information available to
potential investors, the benefits of public-private partnerships, and the role
of donor financing.</font></p>
<p class="HEADLINE3" align="justify"><b><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">SESSION
TWO: CURRENT PRACTICE AND LESSONS LEARNED</font></i></b></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The workshop's
second session, which was held on Tuesday, 28 September, consisted of two
segments. The first focused on "development finance in practice," with four
speakers providing insights and case studies on the subject. This was followed
by a question-and-answer period. The second part of the session examined
barriers and lessons learned in relation to financing, focusing in particular on
case studies from Ghana and China.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">PART I –
DEVELOPMENT FINANCE IN PRACTICE:</font></b><font size="2"> <b>Presentations:</b>
EGTT member Elmer Holt (US), who chaired the first part of the session,
introduced the topic by drawing attention to the commercial realities of
development finance. He observed that, where risk is high and returns are
ill-defined, little can be expected. Meanwhile, at the other end of the
spectrum, projects offering low risks and predictable returns are generating a
lot of interest and activity. The focus of this discussion, he said, would be
those projects that fall in between these extremes.</font></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Peter Storey, Vice
President of Financing, HERA International Group, spoke about private sector
development and financing of technology-related projects, focusing on his
experiences in sub-Saharan Africa. Storey examined the project development
cycle, stressing the need for a thorough pre-development stage that carefully
examines the feasibility of the project. As pre-development costs can amount to
as much as 2% of total project costs with no guarantee of success, he advocated
developing a consortium of interested parties to spread the risk. He then
reviewed a case study, the Zambezi Valley Development Scheme, reflecting on its
successes, failures, and lessons learned. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">He recommended an
integrated approach to projects that engages both public and private sectors,
and said governments must create a stable legislative and regulatory
environment. </font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Peter Rossbach,
Director, Impax Capital Ltd, spoke about Impax's Patient Capital Initiative and
equity finance for renewable energy in emerging markets. He described the
Initiative as a "one-stop shop" with co<span lang="EN-GB">-funding for
local/regional sub-funds, as well as funding for carbon credit purchases and
technical assistance. </span>He highlighted lessons learned and identified
various prerequisites for developing successful renewable energy activities,
including appropriate government regulations and project debt, and acceptable
returns. He also suggested ways of making projects financially viable in the
market, including supporting the development of long-term market forces, the
establishment of policies and regulations that encourage investment, as well as
private funding and official development assistance accompanied by country
co-financing.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Patrick Daddario,
President of the Fiorello H. LaGuardia Foundation, spoke about how to engage
local financial institutions in project development and implementation. He
explained that, since its establishment in 2001, the Foundation has carried out
projects in Brazil, China and India aimed at catalyzing human, institutional and
financial resources to support the development of locally-defined and managed
enterprises engaging in sustainable energy activities. He stated that utilizing
local resources and maintaining environmental, social and financial
sustainability are critical to developing and implementing projects. Asserting
that local financial institutions have the ability and capacity to participate,
he cautioned that projects were unlikely to succeed without their involvement.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Youba Sokona,
Executive Secretary of the Sahara and Sahel Observatory, spoke about the
approach of the African Rural Energy Enterprise Development (AREED) initiative
to public-private partnerships. He listed various challenges in the African
context, including the need to improve people's access to energy services,
support a self-sustaining "scale-up" of energy systems, and create or stimulate
markets. Stressing that no one solution fits all circumstances and that no one
actor can operate in a vacuum, he called for a cooperative approach focused on
connecting multiple partnerships that add value in the areas of financing,
programme development, implementation, enterprise, and service delivery. He
hoped that the current focus on projects would shift towards discussions on the
creation of "portfolios" and ultimately to "systems" of self-supporting products
and services.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">
Question-and-answer session: </font></b><font size="2">In the discussion that
followed, one participant sought clarification on the suggestion that projects
could involve an unbiased "integrator" or consultant to help facilitate them. In
response, Peter Storey explained that this agent can provide credibility and
avoid any conflict of interest by remaining independent of the government and
the development consortium, while also having a commitment to the project.
</font></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A developing
country participant argued for minimizing the costs involved in a project's
pre-development phase, as high costs represent a risk in itself. He also raised
the issue of "bundling" sustainable energy projects at the national or regional
level, which can help reduce overall project development costs. In response,
Patrick Daddario said project bundling offered efficiencies and the potential to
develop ongoing expertise that would lead to lower transaction costs.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One UN expert said
donors should consider shifting away from grant-based technology demonstration
projects towards providing seed capital. He supported seed capital as a donor
mechanism that could be used to support small and medium-sized enterprises and
lead to ongoing activities that could ultimately pull in commercial capital and
lead to sustainable businesses. He referred to this as a "blended" approach that
involves both donor and private financing.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">PART II:
BARRIERS AND LESSONS LEARNED:</font></b><font size="2"> During the second
portion of the session, delegates heard two case studies examining barriers and
lessons learned in Ghana and China. </font></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">William Kojo
Agyemang-Bonsu of Ghana's Environmental Protection Agency reflected on his
country's experiences, stressing that it is imperative to move from negotiations
to implementation in terms of technology transfer. He explained that Ghana had
conducted a thorough technology needs assessment in order to start the
implementation process. The assessment contains a technology implementation
plan, identifies barriers to technology transfer, suggests actions to remove
such barriers, identifies the stakeholders to be involved, and prioritizes key
technologies. He said that the weakest link in the implementation process is the
mechanism for technology transfer, including the financial mechanism. He also
noted that technology transfer should not be based on a formula but should be an
innovative process that includes the concept of learning by doing. He then
presented a case study on the promotion of biomass energy, which requires
financing for technology transfer.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ji Zou, Professor
at Renmin University in China, offered a Chinese perspective on financing the
development and transfer of technologies. He argued that effective technology
transfer under the UNFCCC would require developed countries to meet their
obligations under the Convention. He also identified a need to fill the gap
between the high price set by the private sector for technology transfer and the
weak purchasing power of developing countries. In reviewing practical strategies
for achieving technology transfer, he stressed that financing should bring a
range of benefits, such as poverty alleviation, local environmental improvement,
the creation of jobs and improved infrastructure, consistent policies and plans,
and information sharing. He referred to a project in Inner Mongolia to
demonstrate the importance of combining different financial resources in
implementing technology transfer.</font></p>

THREE: ONGOING INITIATIVES FOR INNOVATIVE FINANCING</font></i></b></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On Tuesday
afternoon, 28 September, participants considered ongoing initiatives for
innovative financing. The session, which was chaired by EGTT member William
Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana), began with three presentations from financial sector
representatives focusing on venture capitalism, emerging markets, and export
credit agencies. This was followed by a question-and-answer session and an
interactive discussion on key issues and linkages.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">
INNOVATIVE FINANCING OPTIONS: Presentations:</font></b><font size="2"> Nicholas
Parker, Chair of Cleantech Venture Network LLC, spoke about trends in clean
energy venture financing. He noted a growing interest among venture capitalists
and others in clean energy, with US$3 billion invested in recent years in new
technologies, mostly in North America and Europe. On opportunities in developing
countries, he differentiated between big economies like China, which he said had
huge potential for leapfrogging that should be driven by the private sector, and
smaller developing countries, which he said need capacity building and training.
He observed that work on renewable energy is already happening on a huge scale
in China and elsewhere.</font></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Frank Joshua, CEO
of the Climate Investment Partnership, discussed opportunities and approaches in
financing renewable energy in emerging markets. He noted that emerging markets
offer significant opportunities for renewable energy projects, citing the case
of China, which is reportedly planning to spend US$120 billion to double energy
capacity by 2010. From an investor's perspective, he stressed that what drives
the market is the risk-adjusted rate of return. One problem with developing
countries is that there is no easy "exit strategy" that would allow investors to
benefit from their investment. He explained that, in industrialized countries,
an investment in wind power, for instance, would offer strong profit potential,
as the initial investor could sell the business as a going concern after several
years through an initial public offering (IPO) on the stock market. This type of
exit strategy needs to become feasible in developing countries, too. Joshua also
raised concerns about monetizing carbon credits, noting that the market and
prices need to be more stable and certain for carbon considerations to have an
impact on decisions about project viability. Highlighting that investment
institutions are generally interested only in large projects, he suggested
bundling as an option for smaller projects.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">John Balint,
International Financial Consulting Ltd, discussed the relevance of export credit
agencies (ECAs), which facilitate trade by insuring against political and
commercial risks, and which also provide some investment insurance and direct
lending. Noting the significant role played by ECAs in some areas, he pointed
out that less than 1% of their exposure is in the areas of renewable energy and
energy efficiency. However, greater involvement could be encouraged if
governments and other shareholders give ECAs clear instructions that encourage
this. He noted that the fourth UNEP ECA annual environmental workshop would be
held shortly and would discuss international guidelines for ECAs.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">
Question-and-answer session: </font></b><font size="2">In the ensuing
discussion, a UN agency representative said it is important to lobby government
finance ministries/departments on the importance of climate change, as they can
influence the private sector in terms of where financial resources flow. John
Balint said ECAs need to present successful examples of their work to
demonstrate to governments the need for their greater involvement in renewable
energy and energy efficiency. Responding to a question about financing options,
Nicholas Parker said they would differ in each case depending on the specific
market conditions, including market size and the project timeframe.</font></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">
Interactive discussion on issues and linkages: </font></b><font size="2">Late on
Tuesday afternoon, participants engaged in an interactive discussion on the
issues raised during the session, and on the linkages and connections between
these issues. Many participants expressed general satisfaction with the
discussions and proposed continuing the dialogue between governments and the
financial sector. One civil society representative said it is critical to
establish a "common language" for such dialogue. He also stressed the need to
integrate discussions on technology transfer financing with the CDM process. One
financial sector speaker expressed his confidence that the financial market will
be increasingly active in the area of climate change and urged governments to
help set the stage for further financing, while a developing country
representative argued that the stage has already been set and that it is time to
move the process forward.</font></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Noting that many
developing countries have now assessed their technology needs, a developing
country participant said it is time to identify how to meet these needs by
establishing action plans. Another developing country representative said
technology transfer has to adopt a sector-by-sector approach. Several non-Annex
I Party representatives also expressed their disappointment with the limited
progress in technology transfer in the context of the UNFCCC. One called on
developing countries and the private sector to work together to develop
projects, and another suggested that more attention be given to mitigation and
adaptation activities that are crucial to developing countries.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Several
participants raised the issue of how to bring the unit costs of renewable energy
down to the level of "old technologies" used to generate electricity from coal
and other fossil fuels. One private sector participant responded that
governments could factor in the actual costs of fossil fuel use, such as the
impact of pollution on human health and the health care system. Replying to a
comment on adaptation activities, Frank Joshua said participants from the
financial sector attending this workshop knew about financing for mitigation
rather than adaptation activities. He suggested that it could be useful to hold
a separate event on financing adaptation activities.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Participants also
discussed what governments can do to catalyze financing, with Frank Joshua
recommending that they could reduce the risks for investors by funding the
development of an effective risk assessment model that the private sector could
then apply to projects. He also urged governments to put in place appropriate
regulatory frameworks.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">OVERVIEW
OF DAY TWO:</font></b><font size="2"> On Wednesday morning, delegates were
presented with a brief wrap-up of the second day of the workshop. Elmer Holt,
who had chaired session two, highlighted comments that financing is not a "bolt
on" element to be added at the end of a process, but needs to be secured early
on. He noted participants' statements that the externalities associated with
fossil fuels must be incorporated into their price if renewable energy financing
is to become more viable. He also drew attention to participants' comments on
the need to: </font></font></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="Bulleted" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">mobilize
local resources and build capacity to help create local entrepreneurs;<br>
 </font></p></li>
<li>
<p class="Bulleted" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">develop
training programmes to educate local banks and other institutions on
financing technology transfer;<br>
 </font></p></li>
<li>
<p class="Bulleted" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">establish
the necessary infrastructure to support technology transfer; and <br>
 </font></p></li>
<li>
<p class="Bulleted" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">develop
appropriate regulatory environments, such as Germany's creation of a
favorable framework for wind power.</font></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Reflecting on the
presentations and discussions during the third session on Tuesday afternoon,
William Agyemang-Bonsu, who had chaired this session, drew attention to the
major opportunities for renewable energy investments in emerging markets, and
investors' growing interest in energy projects. He highlighted comments on the
value of seed financing from governments, the important role of technology needs
assessments and enabling environments in helping leverage funds for technology
transfer, and the benefits of "bundling" replicable, high-quality projects so as
to make them more commercially attractive. He also noted statements on the need
to develop risk assessment models and to structure projects from a technical,
financial and risk perspective so as to increase access to "project debt and
equity." Finally, he drew attention to discussions on the importance of
identifying project synergies that would link climate technologies with
development issues such as water management and poverty.</font></p>
<p class="HEADLINE3" align="justify"><b><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">SESSION
FOUR: OUTCOMES AND POSSIBLE WAYS FORWARD</font></i></b></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The final session
of the workshop took place on Wednesday morning, 29 September. The session
focused on outcomes and ways forward, with deliberations taking place in a
roundtable discussion moderated by EGTT member Bernard Mazijn (Belgium).
Reflecting on the past two days' discussions, Mazijn reminded participants of
the goals established for the workshop, which included fostering a better
understanding of financing issues, sharing experiences and lessons learned,
narrowing differences and generating new ideas. He noted that there had been
significant progress in participants' understanding of financing and that public
and private sector representatives had started to speak a "common language." He
also observed that, while some of the financing options discussed at this
meeting were not necessarily innovative in the financial world, they were new
within the context of the UNFCCC.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Outlining some
next steps for the coming weeks and months, Daniele Violetti of the UNFCCC
Secretariat indicated that a report would be prepared ahead of COP-10/SBSTA-21
in December 2004, and that a two-hour side event would take place at COP-10 on
the issues raised by this workshop.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">
ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION:</font></b><font size="2"> Participants then engaged in a
roundtable debate on the way forward on issues raised at this workshop. An Annex
I Party representative said he had been very encouraged by the discussions, and
felt that some useful proposals and models had been outlined that could be
replicated elsewhere. He felt that although progress had been made, "we are
still speaking several different languages," and suggested that an ongoing
dialogue was needed. He proposed that the next meeting could perhaps be held in
a developing country and also include private sector experts from developing
countries, perhaps with more of a focus on adaptation. A number of other
participants supported an ongoing dialogue with the private sector, and one
industrialized country speaker suggested engaging with both public and private
sector financial institutions, and small and medium enterprises. However, while
several speakers seemed to favor discussions on adaptation, one speaker
preferred a focus on renewable energy and energy efficiency at this stage,
focusing on adaptation later.</font></font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Several developing
country participants stressed that UNFCCC Article 4.5 was the foundation of this
process and said that further clarification of the article's meaning would be
helpful. One said the best way to move ahead was to focus on public-private
partnerships in the context of Article 4.5, while another speaker said it was
clear that developing countries needed assistance in preparing projects to make
them more attractive to investors.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In suggesting a
way forward, some said future discussions should consider both mitigation and
adaptation activities, government roles, the financial resources available in
the public domain, and how to remove barriers in both developed and developing
countries. Others encouraged the UNFCCC to interact with its sister conventions
in the context of technology transfer in order to learn from their experiences.
They emphasized that developing countries should continue to improve enabling
environments for financing technology transfer and develop more demonstration
projects. One participant suggested forwarding text for a draft decision to
SBSTA-21/COP-10 on the promotion of carbon trading in relation to technology
transfer based on the discussions at this workshop. He also suggested holding
further discussions in 2005 and urged the private sector to provide financial
support for this. A participant from the private sector urged developing country
participants to understand ECAs in their countries and to lobby ministries of
finance to support ECAs' involvement in financing technology transfer.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One participant
from an industrialized country proposed strengthening the analytical basis for
work on Article 4.5. Noting that COP-10 was to be held in Buenos Aires, he
quoted the old adage that "it takes two to tango, and one to lead," stressing
that while the private sector's interest is clear, the public sector must push
this process forward.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A developing
country speaker highlighted the role of the CDM in technology transfer. Noting
that governments are often more focused on regulations than on single projects,
he drew attention to the option of a project development fund, especially as the
GEF process can be quite time-consuming. He also recommended further thinking on
adaptation issues. Another developing country speaker said technology needs
assessments should form the basis for the development of strategic plans to move
the process forward. However, he noted that this would require donor support.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Wrapping up the
roundtable,<b> </b>Bernard Mazijn noted comments on the need to consider
adaptation in more detail. On the issue of tools and models, he said it seemed
appropriate to develop a list of existing tools and models, and identify those
that are missing. He also noted some comments on whether some sort of toolkit,
handbook or guidelines would be helpful. He identified calls for an ongoing
dialogue with the private sector, and comments on linking the UNFCCC's work into
wider processes.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Participants
supported Mazijn's overview, although one speaker noted that there had been some
uncertainty in discussions over the value of further guidelines. Several
speakers endorsed building on the work that has already been undertaken and
using the existing tools, including the technology needs assessments. One
participant added a suggestion to recommend to SBSTA the use of existing models
and approaches that have been successful in this area, and another added that
the EGTT can put "flesh on the bones" of these ideas. </font></p>
<p class="HEADLINE3" align="justify"><b><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">CLOSING
REMARKS</font></i></b></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In her closing
comments, workshop Chair Margaret Martin thanked participants for their
openness, concluding that it had been a very productive two-and-a-half days. She
detected a willingness to move forward, particularly in the area of
public-private partnerships. She thanked the organizers, including the UNFCCC
Secretariat and her Canadian colleagues, as well as EGTT members, session
chairs, and all the participants, expressing her gratitude to them for "putting
the word 'work' into this workshop." In particular, she thanked fellow EGTT
members Thomas Verheye of the European Commission and Elmer Holt of the US for
their efforts in making this workshop a success. She also expressed her
gratitude to representatives of the private sector for making themselves
available for this event.</font></p>
<p class="Body" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Wanna
Tanunchaiwatana, UNFCCC Secretariat, thanked Margaret Martin for chairing the
meeting so effectively and Canada for its hospitality. She indicated that the
Secretariat was extremely pleased with the outcome of this workshop, and
informed participants that the report of the workshop would be made available
ahead of COP-10. She hoped for further progress on this issue at
COP-10/SBSTA-21, and noted that ministers will be discussing technology issues
during the high-level segment. She also expressed her appreciation to the donors
for funding this event. The meeting concluded at 12:30 pm.</font></p>

The workshop, which is under the Nairobi Work  Programme on Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change (NWP), was mandated by the UNFCCC&rsquo;s Subsidiary Body for Scientific  and Technological Advice (SBSTA). It brought  together nearly 70 participants, representing governments, and  intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, to discuss integrating  and expanding adaptation planning at national, subnational and local levels,  and to exchange views on lessons learned, good practices, gaps, needs, barriers  and constraints to adaptation. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">The workshop  aimed to advance the subthemes contained in decision 2/CP.11, including in  subparagraph b(ii) &ldquo;Collecting, analyzing and disseminating information on past  and current practical adaptation actions and measures, including adaptation  projects, short- and long-term adaptation strategies, and local and indigenous  knowledge,&rdquo; and b(iv) &ldquo;Facilitating communication and cooperation among and  between parties and relevant organizations, business, civil society, decision  makers and other stakeholders.&rdquo;</p>&#13;

                               <p class="textstory">Adaptation is a  cross-cutting theme under the UNFCCC. After the release of the Third Assessment  Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UNFCCC&rsquo;s  ninth Conference of the Parties (COP 9) in 2003 requested SBSTA to begin work  on scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of impacts of, and  vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change (decision 10/CP.9). The  following year, parties reached a milestone at COP 10 with decision 1/CP.10,  known as the Buenos Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and Response  Measures. COP 10 set up two complementary tracks for adaptation: the  development of a structured five-year programme of work on the scientific,  technical and socioeconomic aspects of impacts of, and vulnerability and  adaptation to, climate change under SBSTA, which was adopted at COP 11 in 2005 (decision 2/CP.11); and the  improvement of information and methodologies, implementation of concrete  adaptation activities, technology transfer and capacity building under the  Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI).</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">In November 2006,  COP 12 renamed the SBSTA five-year work programme the &ldquo;Nairobi Work Programme  on Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change.&rdquo; The work programme  aims to assist countries, in particular developing countries (including least  developed countries and small island developing states), to improve their  understanding and assessment of impacts, vulnerability and adaptation. It also  aims to assist countries in making informed decisions on practical adaptation  actions and measures to respond to climate change on a sound scientific,  technical and socioeconomic basis, taking into account current and future  climate change and variability. To achieve these goals, the NWP has nine areas  of work, namely: methods and tools; data and observations; climate modeling,  scenarios and downscaling; climate-related risks and extreme events;  socioeconomic information; adaptation planning and practices research;  technologies for adaptation; and economic diversification. The expected  outcomes of the NWP are:</p>&#13;

                               <p class="textstory">The workshop  opened on Monday, 12 October 2009, with an introduction by SBSTA Chair Helen  Plume (New Zealand),  who welcomed participants. She highlighted that the workshop is being held  under the NWP work area on adaptation planning and practices, and that the aim  is to discuss integration of approaches to adaptation planning and identify how  to enable implementation of good practices. Roberto Acosta, UNFCCC Secretariat,  invited participants to discuss, <em>inter alia</em>: how the NWP can support the  agreed Copenhagen  outcome; how the outputs of the workshop and the NWP can be disseminated to  relevant stakeholders at the national and local levels; and content and organization  of the mandated technical workshop on regional centers and networks. Xianfu Lu,  UNFCCC Secretariat, provided a background to the NWP, its functions, objectives  and expected outputs, underscoring that its primary objective is to assist all  parties, particularly developing country parties, to improve their  understanding and assessment of climate change impacts and vulnerability, in  order to enhance their ability to make relevant decisions. She emphasized broad  and active participation as central to achieving the NWP&rsquo;s objectives. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory"><em><strong>SESSION 2:  SETTING THE SCENE</strong></em></p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">During this  morning session, participants heard presentations and discussed theories on the  integration of approaches to adaptation planning, as well as practical  considerations related to integration.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory"><strong>INTEGRATION OF  APPROACHES TO ADAPTATION PLANNING: </strong>Heather McGray,  World Resources Institute (WRI), noted that the question of integration is not  straightforward and can refer to: integration of development and adaptation  needs through a planning process into climate-resilient development; or  integration of different planning approaches with each other to, <em>inter alia</em>,  avoid overlap, identify gaps and enable synergies. McGray underscored that it  may be useful to think about countries as having a system for adaptation, not  unlike an ecosystem, and then address the overarching objectives of the system  and what roles each player within the system fills. She identified two  questions for further discussion: what prevents effective integration of  adaptation planning; and where are the opportunities for better integration?</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Golam Rabbani, Bangladesh  Centre for Advanced Studies, identified practical issues related to advancing  integration of approaches to adaptation planning, noting that it presents an  opportunity to deal effectively with the sustainable development challenges  posed by climate change. He emphasized political, technical, institutional and  financial challenges to the integration of adaptation planning. Rabbani said  that national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs), allocation of funds and  creation of national high-level committees serve as entry points for  integration at the national level. He also stressed the importance of enabling  environments, including public awareness, institutional arrangements for  mainstreaming adaptation, engagement of stakeholders and development of good  practices. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">During the  ensuing discussion, Argentina  asked if a system existed for the flow of resources to communities in Bangladesh,  noting the country&rsquo;s impressive budget allocation for adaptation. India raised  the issue of &ldquo;readiness cost,&rdquo; and asked about additional costs imposed on  business and governments to increase resilience. McGray noted a number of  approaches to costing adaptation activities.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Sudan asked about  the role of NAPAs in Bangladesh in enhancing the process of integrating  adaptation into planning, noting challenges particularly with international  integration, where a full understanding of sustainable development is still  lacking. Rabbani explained how Bangladesh  developed its NAPA,  highlighting six sectoral groups, multi-stakeholder involvement and the  establishment of a climate change institution within the government. However,  he stressed the need for improved coordination among key ministries. McGray  noted the benefits of ecosystem approaches to planning, but said integration  would inevitably be needed. Greentrack stressed the importance of considering a  cross-sectoral approach to adaptation as part of an overall sustainable  development strategy. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Participants also  raised issues related to: the possibility of having a single system for  adaptation; uncertainties and time dimensions when dealing with integration  approaches; and consideration of the costs and benefits of adaptation in  parallel.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory"><strong>APPROACHES TO  AND EXPERIENCES IN ADAPTATION PLANNING AT NATIONAL, SUBNATIONAL, COMMUNITY AND  LOCAL LEVELS:</strong> Festus Luboyera, UNFCCC Secretariat,  presented a synthesis of the submissions from parties and organizations on  approaches to and experiences in adaptation planning and action at national,  subnational, community and local levels (FCCC/SBSTA/2009/MISC.4). He outlined  specific elements from the submissions on: integration across levels, sectors,  livelihoods and hazards, as well as integration in general; lessons learned and  good practices; gaps and needs; and issues for further consideration. On  lessons learned, Luboyera highlighted: increasing and improving the  effectiveness of cooperation between levels and sectors; scaling up pilot  studies and expanding community-based adaptation; and identifying the most  effective entry points for integrating adaptation. On issues for further  consideration, he identified, <em>inter alia</em>, the need to create and adopt  legal frameworks for the systematic consideration of climate change in national  level planning processes.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory"><em><strong>SESSION 3: INTEGRATION OF ADAPTATION PLANNING  ACROSS LEVELS</strong></em></p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">In the afternoon,  Sandra Lorena Santamaria Rojas, Colombia,  presented on the integration of adaptation across different administrative  levels in Colombia,  focusing on their Integrated National Adaptation Plan, which includes pilot  projects on increasing availability of climate variability information,  adaptation actions in high-mountain ecosystems and coastal areas, and  responding to climate-driven changes in the incidence of vector-borne diseases.  She emphasized that these projects aim to integrate environmental issues into  national planning processes, attain the Millennium Development Goals and  increase local capacity to adapt to climate change. In terms of lessons  learned, Rojas highlighted, <em>inter alia</em>: the need to integrate long- and  short-term objectives to increase political attractiveness; decentralization;  enhancing early warning systems and vulnerability risk assessments to identify  short-, medium- and long-term priorities; and community involvement.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Christopher West,  UK, described nested  adaptation in the UK and  integration across administrative levels, the evolution of adaptation in the UK and the role  of the UK Climate Impacts Programme. He described: top-down approaches related  to the downward flow of adaptive capacity, such as scientific knowledge,  integration and resources; and bottom-up approaches related to delivering  adaptation action, such as assurance, &ldquo;best&rdquo; practices, and local experiences  and diversity of approaches. He pointed to a number of challenges, including  managing risk and not transferring risk to other environments or future  generations, and said that &ldquo;efficiency may be the enemy of resilience.&rdquo;</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">During the  ensuing debate, participants discussed issues related to, <em>inter alia</em>:  progress made towards measuring adaptation and identifying what constitutes a  &ldquo;best&rdquo; practice; process-based rather than results-based measurements;  government coverage of risk versus private insurance; advancing legislation to  bring in private sector insurance providers; and sustainability of adaptation.  In response to a question by Practical Action, who pointed to growing  grassroots movements towards a low-carbon future, West noted that adaptation is  often ignored by the general public and local community groups, and that often  mitigation and adaptation actions are not linked. He said mitigation was a  simpler concept, while noting difficulties with delivering it effectively, but  emphasized that adaptation, while more difficult to understand, was easier to  address once the concept is grasped.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Shardul Agrawala,  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), discussed  integration of adaptation across different administrative levels. He identified  adaptation entry points at the national, sectoral, local and project levels,  highlighting areas where climate change risks need to be considered and  adaptation can be integrated. Agrawala described the OECD&rsquo;s proposed &ldquo;climate  lens,&rdquo; which involves determining the extent to which: specific policies, plans  or projects could be vulnerable to climate risks; these climate risks have  already been taken into consideration; and policies, plans or projects could  lead to increased vulnerability or maladaptation. He also underlined the  importance of adaptation cost estimates, particularly at the national level. In  the ensuing discussion, participants discussed how to collect information on  adaptation costs and the importance of ecosystem-based adaptation to ensure  coherence across different sectors. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Rachel Berger,  Practical Action, presented on linking adaptation planning and implementation  from community to national levels, highlighting that community-based adaptation  is based on, <em>inter alia</em>: increased understanding of the climatic changes  that people perceive; building on local knowledge; reducing vulnerability;  strengthening resilience to shocks; and building adaptive capacity. She noted  the need for a bottom-up approach, replicating what works and mainstreaming  good practices and relevant knowledge. Berger identified the need to improve:  incorporation of ecosystem management into adaptation planning; understanding  of the interdependencies between economic, social and ecological systems;  conflict resolution; and use of bottom-up approaches.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">During the  discussions, the World Bank highlighted the need to distinguish between  &ldquo;ecosystem resilience,&rdquo; &ldquo;ecosystem-based adaptation&rdquo; and &ldquo;ecosystem  approaches.&rdquo; In response to a query, Berger emphasized that it is necessary to  mesh levels by scaling up what works at the local level, while recognizing that  at higher levels, some issues will have to be fed back down in order to achieve  sustainability.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory"><em><strong>SESSION 4: INTEGRATION OF ADAPTATION PLANNING  ACROSS ECONOMIC SECTORS</strong></em></p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">On Monday  afternoon, Armi Susandi, Indonesia, discussed integration of adaptation  planning across economic sectors in Indonesia. He discussed a programme  on mainstreaming climate in small island development in Lombok,  which resulted in the establishment of a taskforce under gubernatorial decree  with clear goals, role divisions, members, a working mechanism, and activities  and facilities. Regarding a vulnerability assessment of climate change in Jakarta, he emphasized vulnerability, particularly to  floods, and said many people come from outside Jakarta and, therefore, lack the traditional  knowledge to adapt. He noted quick recovery from floods, but pointed to low  stakeholder coordination, community awareness and water quality. He highlighted  challenges, including: uncertainty in climate change prediction; low priority  given to adaptation in national and local government planning; gaps between  international negotiations and national and local policies; and ensuring local  adaptation actions. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Participants  discussed issues related to: the challenges of low probability, high impact  events for planning and decision making; recovery from floods versus recovery  from socioeconomic losses; and the Jakarta  case study.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Jacqui Yeates, New Zealand, presented an overview of current  strategies and practices for, as well as lessons learned in, integrating  climate change adaptation across sectors in New Zealand. She underlined the  system of cross-government coordination, under which relevant government  departments carry out adaptation-related activities. These departments meet  regularly, coordinated by the lead agency &ndash; the Ministry of Environment &ndash; to  discuss relevant issues in order to, <em>inter alia</em>, avoid duplication of  work. She also said that the Resource Management Act, as well as the central  government&rsquo;s climate change website, are useful tools for integration.  Regarding lessons learned, Yeates highlighted: coordination across government  departments; the need to work with the willing; involving the user community in  developing guidance; the role of legislation and regulation; and &ldquo;uncertainty&rdquo;  as a challenge. &nbsp;</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Following the  presentation, participants discussed: the practical application of adaptation  integration in the transport, health and tourism sectors; the role of  cross-government coordination; and how to deal with &ldquo;uncertainty.&rdquo; Responding  to a question by Saint Lucia  about working with insurers, Yeates said the Ministry of Environment, <em>inter  alia</em>, provides them with information regarding potential climate events and  risks that could require insurance.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Ajith Silva, Sri Lanka,  highlighted the National Action Plan for Haritha Lanka Programme, which  promotes adaptation through simple lifestyles, efficient use of resources, low  resource footprints, enhanced conservation of natural capital, and good  governance for adaptation planning. He noted that one successful strategy for  adaptation is returning to traditional methods modified to suit changing  conditions. He also underscored use of hazard mapping, identification of  vulnerable areas and national transition to a green economy.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Carlos Fuller,  Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre, discussed the Caribbean  perspective and gave an overview of current initiatives to determine: the  extent of risk; vulnerability of and impacts on natural and socioeconomic  systems; costs of mitigating impacts; and building regional capacity. He also  discussed methodologies for defining risk and mainstreaming adaptation, such as  downscaling, outlined modeling results to date, and identified steps to  adaptation, including: use of regional climate models and development of regional  climate scenarios; cost-benefit analysis of adaptation options and the cost of  inaction; and mainstreaming adaptation into national development planning. He  highlighted a case study of agriculture in Guyana, and discussed impacts of  climate change on the agriculture sector and challenges to specific subsectors,  including livestock systems, fisheries and forestry. He noted lack of  sufficient institutional capacity, said current policies and laws do not  address climate change issues directly, and made recommendations related to, <em>inter  alia</em>: enhancing technical and institutional capacity; policies and  legislation; research and development; and awareness raising and communication.  Responding to a question related to planning in the Guyana case, Fuller noted training  of agriculture professionals and regional scientists on use of models.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Louis Bockel, UN  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), discussed experiences of integrating  adaptation planning at the national and community levels in the agriculture sector.  On planning approaches and tools, he described: a toolkit for planning local  adaptation with farmers, which involves assessing current and future climate  vulnerability and risks, promoting institutional adaptive capacity, identifying  options and designing location-specific strategies; and productive  socio-environmental safety nets, based on municipality involvement and  watershed climate resilience building. He also highlighted challenges,  including ways of: scaling up integration of adaptation into food security  strategies; exploiting the synergy between adaptation and mitigation; and  reaching farmers to work on climate change adaptation. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">In the ensuing  dialogue, discussions focused on the cost of adaptation programmes and the risk  of maladaptation. Responding to questions, Bockel underlined that  locally-manageable tools are usually better and easier to use than more complex  ones.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory"><em><strong>SESSION 5: INTEGRATION OF ADAPTATION PLANNING  ACROSS HAZARD TYPES</strong></em></p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">On Tuesday  morning, 13 October, Klaus Radunsky, Austria, described adaptation planning in  his country, highlighting an action plan on climate change for the Alps, flood  risk management, addressing needs at the subnational scale and adaptation  planning within the European Union. He noted that these projects enhance  adaptive capacity and reduce vulnerability through use of traditional  intergovernmental coordination and new participatory processes. Radunsky  emphasized that planning efforts should: be informed by science; create  networks linking subnational, national, regional and international levels; take  stepwise iterative approaches; and have the capability to manage complex  processes to address impacts in an integrated manner.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">In ensuing  discussions, participants addressed how to involve the public sector, integration  with regional and international policy processes, and challenges faced in  getting all stakeholders to the table to work together. In response to  questions, Radunsky noted that the added value of cooperation, legislation that  creates frameworks for inclusion of stakeholders and the economic losses  created by damage, all increase the likelihood of stakeholder cooperation.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Vladimir Guevara,  Cuba, outlined Cuba&rsquo;s  experiences in adapting to weather and climate hazards. Regarding integration  strategies, he highlighted preparing for both current and future hazards,  including through: capacity building, disaster preparedness, early warning  systems, climate prediction, and hazard vulnerability and risk studies, for  short-term hazards; and capacity building, disaster preparedness, research  projects on sea level rise, submission of national communications and the  development of national adaptation strategies, for long-term hazards. He  described Cuba&rsquo;s  hazard vulnerability and risk process, under which a national expert group was  created to prepare, review and approve guidelines for specific hazards. He said  for each hazard, the expert group produces: one report for each municipality;  one report per province; hazard, vulnerability and risk maps; and  recommendations for disaster reduction plans, considering the disaster  reduction cycle. On lessons learned and good practices, Guevara highlighted  knowledge dissemination, capacity building and training, as well as approaches,  systems, measures and options covering different administrative levels, sectors  and hazards.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">In the subsequent  discussion, participants highlighted private sector engagement and the role of  regional centers of excellence.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Julio Garcia, UN  International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), emphasized that climate  change is a new problem, but disasters are not. He provided an overview of the  Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction, which concluded that  disaster risk is intensively concentrated, unevenly distributed and increasing  rapidly and is driven by deficient urban and local governance. Noting disaster  risk reduction (DRR) is part of adaptation, he said linking DRR and climate  change adaptation offers a win-win opportunity as, <em>inter alia</em>, they both  aim to enhance sustainability and resilience, and DRR can promote early  adaptation. He discussed how to promote links and the need to integrate both  into development plans, stressing the importance of a culture of prevention to  reduce risk. Participants discussed quantifying total losses for a specific  hazard when it reaches a particular area and disaggregating information, the  difficulty of selling DRR politically, and insurance and risk transfer  mechanisms as complementary in addressing DRR.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Gernot Laganda,  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), discussed UNDP&rsquo;s experience in  supporting integration of adaptation planning, highlighting that most of its  work relates to capacity development, and takes place at three levels: enabling  activities, project preparation, and project implementation and analysis. He  outlined lessons learned mainly from the second level, including: countries&rsquo;  desire to move away from studies and reports to concrete action; the potential for  complexity in adaptation planning, the need for pragmatism and focus on  concrete implementation; integrating adaptation into ongoing planning processes  through a range of entry points; and that other sectors and practice areas also  provide opportunities for adaptation planning in addition to discrete  adaptation projects.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">In the ensuing  dialogue, participants discussed the role of the UN system in mobilizing  support for adaptation, ways of communicating risks to relevant stakeholders  and the sharing of climate change information among government departments.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory"><em><strong>SESSION 6: BREAKOUT GROUPS</strong></em></p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">On Tuesday  morning and afternoon, three parallel breakout groups discussed integration of  approaches to adaptation planning across levels, economic sectors, and by  hazard type, respectively. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory"><strong>GROUP A:  INTEGRATION OF APPROACHES TO ADAPTATION PLANNING ACROSS LEVELS:</strong> This breakout group, co-facilitated by Nana K&uuml;nkel (Germany), and  William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana), began with an inventory of current  integrative practices, addressing the what, where, who and how of such  practices. </p>&#13;

                               <p class="textstory">Regarding  an analysis of current practices, participants focused on enabling factors, as  well as technical, financial, political and institutional barriers. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">On  enabling factors, a number of participants stressed that civil society plays an  important integrating role. The degree of decentralization and the ability of  local governments to take action were stressed, as was an ICLEI publication on  climate change integration. Uganda  discussed climate change impacts on food security. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Other  enabling factors identified included:</p>&#13;
                               <ul>&#13;
                                 <li class="textstory">information  and stakeholder consultation;</li>&#13;

                               </ul>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Regarding  barriers, ICLEI urged opening up the NAPA  process to all developing countries and advocated that national governments  take local governments into consideration. New Zealand stressed the importance  of working in partnership with the right people. The UK said that government employees  often only remain in their posts for a short time and highlighted the  importance of maintaining institutional memory. He also stressed the  intersection between sectoral and geographic interests. The Pacific Regional Environment  Programme (SPREP) said that political factors can help, but can also interfere,  with the prioritization process. Greentrack noted lack of integration among  levels in the US,  as well as lack of consideration of and planning for adaptation, noting most of  the attention is given to mitigation.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Other  barriers identified by participants related to lack of: capacity by research  institutions to disseminate information; capacity building; centralized  information collection of alternatives and options; a legally-binding agreement  on adaptation; and financial resources.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">In  coming up with priorities and recommendations, the group identified and broke  into subgroups to address three issues: providing appropriate information,  policy environment, and capacity building. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">The  group on information reported that types of information could include case  studies, system information and tools, which would be required from global to  local levels, and suggested national level climate change offices could, in  part, undertake the task of providing appropriate information. They highlighted  that information could be disseminated through: the internet; human networks  and stakeholder engagement; and the media.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">The  group on policy environment noted the cross-cutting nature of the issue and  identified the following recommendations: executive briefings to political  leaders on climate information and adaptation-related issues, as well as on  social and economic consequences of climate change impacts; and legal and  institutional frameworks.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">The  group on capacity building identified the need to better understand climate  change issues and share knowledge at various levels. They said that where  national capacity is lacking, external support from regional centers should be  drawn upon. They recommended communication of experiences and needs to local  governments by civil society, empowerment training run by NGOs, training of  trainers at the government level, and stakeholder participation in the planning  process.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory"><strong>GROUP B: INTEGRATION OF APPROACHES TO ADAPTATION PLANNING ACROSS  ECONOMIC SECTORS:</strong> This session was co-facilitated  by Dawn Pierre-Nathoniel (Saint Lucia),  and Thomas Kolly (Switzerland).  Pierre-Nathoniel outlined three areas for discussion: stocktaking of current  practices; analysis of current practices; and identification of priority areas  and challenges, with recommendations to address them. She invited participants  to discuss and analyze current integrative practices in, <em>inter alia</em>, the  agriculture, health, energy, water, transport, tourism, construction and  coastal zone sectors, and to make recommendations.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Regarding  the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors, the FAO described their  national programmes for food security. Austria highlighted the use of hail  insurance in some regions in his country. China outlined: the establishment  of a group to deal with climate change mitigation and adaptation; and national  climate change strategies. Bangladesh  discussed development of drought- and saline-tolerant crop varieties. South Africa  described the use of extension officers to train subsistence farmers on proper  farming practices and water resource management. Regarding the health sector,  the World Health Organization (WHO) described networks of collaborating  centers, early warning systems, and capacity building workshops on climate  change and health at national and subnational levels. Sri Lanka  underlined near-total eradication of malaria in his country, while noting  ongoing problems with dengue fever. Discussing the energy and water sectors, Egypt highlighted the use of institutions to  enhance international and regional cooperation, and Nepal described changes to water  resource management to address problems of water availability. Saint Lucia  described a water conservation project based on rainwater harvesting, and  sewage treatment and recycling. Regarding the tourism sector, Nepal highlighted the promotion of ecotourism  and Egypt  emphasized the importance of a strong monitoring system. Discussing the  transport sector, Austria  outlined measures to protect transport infrastructure from storm disturbances. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">On  challenges, participants highlighted: the risk of maladaptation and the  negative health outcomes that could result from decisions taken in other  sectors; lack of awareness; problems with local implementation; lack of  technologies for long-term climate prediction; and policy and political  barriers such as the short-term nature of most planning processes. Discussing  the sectors generally, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) noted the  need for better forecasting and better climate services, particularly for  developing countries, and described the Global Framework for Climate Services,  which is due to be implemented soon. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Participants  identified priorities and recommendations, including: increased awareness  raising; climate change capacity building and training; tools for adaptation in  various sectors; and enhanced experience-sharing. Sri   Lanka highlighted integrated town planning and Austria noted  the need to disseminate information to the relevant people. Egypt  underlined strong institutional monitoring capacity. The FAO recommended  providing &ldquo;no-regret&rdquo; options, such as DRR, to politicians as a way of  addressing the problem of uncertainty. China underlined the need for more  institutional capacity, particularly in terms of increasing the number of staff  working directly on climate change-related issues in ministries. Poland  identified the need for enabling legislation to facilitate consideration of  climate change issues in the housing sector.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory"><strong>GROUP C: INTEGRATION OF APPROACHES TO ADAPTATION PLANNING ACROSS  HAZARD TYPES:</strong> This breakout group was  co-facilitated by Andrew Ure (Australia)  and Amjad Abdulla (Maldives).  The group proceeded by identifying different types of hazards, discussing benefits  of integrating adaptation across hazards, examining case studies of  integration, identifying gaps in or barriers to integration, and producing  recommendations on how to integrate across hazards. Hazards identified  included, <em>inter alia</em>: tropical cyclones, floods, droughts, heat waves,  landslides, glacier lake outburst floods, hail storms, forest fires, sea level  rise, and saline intrusion into freshwater aquifers. The group highlighted the  differences between primary and secondary hazards and extreme events versus  slow-onset or long-term hazards.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Participants  identified the benefits of integration across hazards, including: </p>&#13;
                               <ul>&#13;
                                 <li class="textstory">strengthening  response planning;</li>&#13;
                                 <li class="textstory">providing a  central point of contact and communication for disaster response;</li>&#13;
                                 <li class="textstory">sharing tools  and methodologies across types of disaster responses;</li>&#13;
                                 <li class="textstory">avoiding gaps  and maladaptation; and</li>&#13;
                                 <li class="textstory">enabling prioritization of institutional, technical and financial  resources for integration across hazards.</li>&#13;
                               </ul>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">In  discussing integration across hazards, participants highlighted successful  experiences in the Caribbean, Argentina,  Bangladesh, the UK and the Maldives. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Participants  noted, however, that lack of information can lead to maladaptation and inhibit  coordination with local communities, highlighting that participatory processes  are frequently discussed but often do not happen when needed most. They also  underscored that adaptation occurs on longer time scales than the political  cycle, causing a mismatch between needs and political will. Participants then  discussed the impact of local perceptions of disasters, such as religious and  cultural views on adaptation. Other issues highlighted included: learning from  the disaster management community; the importance of information on  vulnerability; the need for a functional system in the short-term and a  long-term system for addressing underlying causes of vulnerability;  coordination across institutions; and the importance of sharing lessons learned  across levels.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Participants  then discussed recommendations for integrating approaches to adaptation across  hazards. Five recommendations emerged from the group: </p>&#13;
                               <ul>&#13;
                                 <li class="textstory">recognizing  the value of stakeholder participation at all levels in planning processes;</li>&#13;
                                 <li class="textstory">making the  best use of existing institutional knowledge and resources in adaptation planning;</li>&#13;
                                 <li class="textstory">encouraging  information exchange at all levels for the integration of planning across  hazard types;</li>&#13;
                                 <li class="textstory">recognizing  that legal instruments can incentivize integration, with participants noting  that climate change projections should be integrated into ongoing initiatives  to update and strengthen existing regulations or standards, such as building  codes; and</li>&#13;
                                 <li class="textstory">encouraging capacity building for hazard mapping to facilitate  adaptation planning, specifically at the community and national levels. </li>&#13;
                               </ul>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory"><em><strong>SESSION 7: REPORTING BACK FROM BREAKOUT GROUPS</strong></em></p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">On Wednesday  morning, 14 October, the breakout groups reported back to the workshop plenary  on their discussions and recommendations.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory"><strong>GROUP A: </strong>Christopher West (UK)  reported on the breakout group on the integration of approaches to adaptation  planning across levels. Discussing specific practices and how they promote  integration, he used NAPAs as an example, noting that they: bring together  donors and different parts of a country&rsquo;s government; enhance integration with  other national goals; are country owned; and build capacity throughout  government. He noted other practices, including: regional climate centers,  which enable information sharing and emergence of best practices; the National  Rural Employment Guarantee Act in rural India, which promotes adaptation;  and those related to disaster reduction, which overlap with and complement  adaptation. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">He said the group  identified more enabling factors than barriers, characterizing enabling factors  as stages in the adaptation process, pointing to, <em>inter alia</em>, national  legislation and capacity to downscale climate models. He said the barriers  identified were not insurmountable and that the group had suggested ways to  overcome barriers. He noted that adaptation is not always labeled as such. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">West said the  group identified three priority areas and formulated a number of  recommendations, including:</p>&#13;
                               <ul>&#13;
                                 <li class="textstory">providing  appropriate information;</li>&#13;
                                 <li class="textstory">enhancing the  policy environment, through briefings to policy makers on climate and  adaptation issues, and a suitable legal/institutional framework; and</li>&#13;
                                 <li class="textstory">building  capacity to: understand climate and adaptation issues at national and  subnational levels; share knowledge at the local level, with assistance from  NGOs; and participate in local planning processes, with the help of NGOs. </li>&#13;
                               </ul>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">During the  discussion, ICLEI emphasized the local government climate roadmap as one of the  practices the group had identified. Responding to a query about the  international level and negotiations under the UNFCCC, West clarified that the  group did not discuss the international level in much detail.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory"><strong>GROUP B:</strong> Co-Facilitator Pierre-Nathoniel presented the report of discussions  in the breakout group on integration of approaches to adaptation planning  across economic sectors. She outlined discussion on: identified sectors;  current practices across the sectors; barriers, challenges and gaps; enabling  factors, good practices and lessons learned; and recommendations. On  recommendations, she identified the need for: capacity building and training;  research and assessment; development of guidelines and tools; enhanced  technology transfer; information dissemination; funding support, including  through the Kyoto Protocol Adaptation Fund; and programme-based approaches to  adaptation integration. Pierre-Nathoniel also gave some closing thoughts  drawing on the group&rsquo;s discussion, urging caution regarding maladaptation,  identifying innovative ways to bridge gaps, and demonstrating willingness to  implement adaptation integration through the outcomes of ongoing negotiations  under the climate regime. She underlined recognition in the group that although  there are some examples of the cross-sectoral integration of adaptation approaches,  the standard approach to adaptation is still predominantly sectoral. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Following this  presentation, participants highlighted the importance of private sector  engagement, including through public-private partnerships, risk insurance,  enabling frameworks, including policy and regulatory frameworks, and combining  bottom-up and top-down approaches to adaptation.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory"><strong>GROUP C:</strong> Rapporteur Kemi Seesink, Wetlands International, noted that in the  group on integrating adaptation approaches across hazards, participants had  discussed: the importance of information on local situations and data for  addressing impacts; making best use of tools and methods; the usefulness of  multi-stakeholder and multi-country dialogues, such as those on transboundary  watercourses; and integrating climate change into environmental impact  assessments (EIAs). She then highlighted hazards identified by the group,  benefits of integrating adaptation approaches across hazards, and  recommendations. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">The OECD noted  the challenges of using EIAs as a vehicle for integrating adaptation, as EIAs  address project impacts on the environment and what is required for the  purposes of adaptation is assessing the environmental impacts on the project.  Seesink underscored that discussions had reflected this complexity, and Trinidad and Tobago  emphasized that their EIA process includes the impacts of the project on the  environment and, vice versa, stressing the necessity of incorporating risk  assessment of climate change impacts into project planning. Ghana noted the  use of strategic environmental assessments in mainstreaming climate change  adaptation into programmes, policies and plans, in addition to specific  projects.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">The FAO asked  what additional action is required to supplement existing DRR institutional  arrangements in order to facilitate adaptation. ISDR noted that addressing  disaster prevention is a critical addition to DRR in order to shift away from a  reactive system. Austria  emphasized that governance is critical, as is disseminating information on risk  to local communities. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory"><em><strong>SESSION 8: PERSPECTIVES FOR ADAPTATION PLANNING</strong></em></p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">On Wednesday  morning, Chair Plume discussed the benefits of taking a gender-sensitive  approach to climate change and adaptation, noting that women, particularly poor  women, are disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change. She  stressed that when adaptation is planned and practiced, women should not only  be involved in decision making, but that everyone should be made aware of the  links. She stressed that women are adaptation planners and implementers, as  well as important and effective agents of change, particularly at the community  level, where they are often the &ldquo;cement&rdquo; of the communities. Plume discussed  sharing knowledge through women, and said women should be made aware of  suitable solutions and be recipients of capacity building. She stressed that  gender consciousness is about equity, noting that when both men and women are  educated, adaptation strategies can be more effective.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Mozaharul Alam,  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), discussed the ecosystem approach  to adaptation integration, stressing that it only represents one approach to  integration and may not be suitable in every situation. He outlined the climate  components of different ecosystems that are most susceptible to climate change  impacts, including: temperature in mountain ecosystems, leading to glacier  melting and retreat; sea level rise, cyclones and storms in the marine and  estuarine ecosystems, which cause water, health and housing issues, as well as  coral bleaching and fisheries decline; rainfall intensity and distribution in  freshwater ecosystems, affecting water and agriculture sectors, as well as  livelihoods; and temperature and rainfall in dryland ecosystems, affecting  agriculture, health and domestic water use. He highlighted that the ecosystem  approach enables consideration of different climate elements in different  situations, areas and sectors, and that its focus is on the well-being of  ecological and human systems. On the way forward, Alam identified: moving  beyond conceptual discussions to pilot-scale implementation and  learning-by-doing; regional cooperation; generating and sharing knowledge and  information; and developing tools and methods to implement the ecosystem  approach.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Espen Ronneberg,  SPREP, presented perspectives on adaptation planning in the Pacific region in  relation to stakeholder engagement, highlighting SPREP&rsquo;s experiences of  engaging communities in the development of adaptation projects. He noted that  the process was interactive, and engaged national officials and communities,  including local leaders, women&rsquo;s groups and youth. Ronneberg said that  communities agreed on priorities and exchanged information with national  officials and project planners on their needs and vulnerabilities, and that  national governments then brought in policy views to address bottom-up concerns  and interests. Regarding lessons learned, Ronneberg emphasized that: planning  processes improve public awareness and preparedness; climate change risk information  should be accessible to the average citizen; drama and art are useful tools to  disseminate climate change information and engage youth; and raising community  awareness enables them to take action for themselves and to take part more  effectively in larger and more comprehensive adaptation projects. He identified  that strong national level commitment to participatory processes, avoiding  parachute projects, and community engagement are necessary to ensure project  sustainability.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Fred Onduri  Machulu (Uganda) and Chair of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG),  presented on NAPAs, and links between climate change adaptation and national  planning, explaining that NAPAs provide a process for least developed countries  (<a href="http://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/ldc/items/2666.php" target="_blank" class="linknegro">LDCs</a>) to identify priority  activities that respond to their <strong>urgent</strong> and <strong>immediate</strong> adaptation  needs. He noted that NAPAs offer LDCs the opportunity to create national,  country-owned plans. Regarding the current status of NAPAs, he said that 43  LDCs have prepared NAPAs, but lamented that only US$176 million is available in  the LDC Fund, compared to the US$1.7 billion needed. He said the LEG provides  an advisory role in the NAPA process, including  through production of annotated guidelines for NAPA preparation and collaboration with  implementing agencies. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">He then discussed  strengths, weaknesses and opportunities of NAPAs. Regarding strengths, he  noted, <em>inter alia</em>, the participatory and consultative approach of NAPAs.  He said weaknesses include: lack of a timeline for NAPA preparation and implementation phases;  and absence of a mechanism for monitoring implementing agencies and penalties  for non-compliance. He identified opportunities as: stakeholder appreciation of  NAPAs; creation of the LDC Fund for financing NAPA activities; and bilateral and national  interest in funding activities outside the LDC Fund. He pointed to evidence of NAPA integration into national development plans, such as  the multi-sectoral composition of NAPA  teams, and said NAPAs have captured the voices and needs at the grassroots  level. He said challenges include limited resources and complex access  procedures, limited adaptation and climate change awareness, inadequate  capacities within the LDCs and implementing agencies, lack of timelines for  stakeholders, and lack of monitoring and reporting mechanisms between the  Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the implementing agencies.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">In the ensuing  discussion, participants commented on: the distinction between climate change  impacts and underlying vulnerability factors or causes; the importance of  multi-sectoral NAPA teams; country-drivenness in the NAPA process; the need to  revise and update NAPAs and the projects identified in them; the gap between the  funds available and the funds required for NAPA implementation; possible  expansion of the NAPA process to other developing countries; and the importance  of dialogue and communication between the GEF, implementing agencies and  countries during the NAPA preparation process.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory"><em><strong>SESSION 9: UPDATES FROM PARTIES AND PARTNER  ORGANIZATIONS</strong></em></p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">On Wednesday  afternoon, Chair Plume invited parties and partner organizations to present  updates on their activities under the NWP. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">ICLEI, noting  that they have worked on adaptation since 2002, highlighted a new pledge to  host an annual conference on adaptation in cities immediately prior to the  UNFCCC Subsidiary Body meetings. The first will be a three-day event, called  Resilient Cities 2010, to be held in May 2010 in Bonn, Germany, bringing together experts and  practitioners to share knowledge and experiences on vulnerability and risk  assessments, municipal strategies and policies and case studies of local  adaptation practices. The outcomes of these forums will be transmitted to the  UNFCCC to facilitate inclusion of the issues faced by municipalities in  implementing the Convention.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">WHO highlighted  that since their action pledge, the World Health Assembly had signed a  resolution on climate and health. The associated action plan has facilitated  increasing advocacy capacity; raising awareness; engaging the health sector in  coordination with other UN agencies and national and international networks;  generating scientific evidence and monitoring the health impacts of climate  change; and strengthening health systems to address the health impacts of  climate change through training, early warning, vulnerability and risk  assessments, as well as actual projects. She noted that the results of these  efforts will be posted on the NWP website.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">WMO reported on  the key outcome of the World Climate Conference 3, which agreed to develop and  implement the Global Framework for Climate Services, the aim of which is to  enable better management of the risks of climate variability and change through  development and incorporation of science-based climate information and  prediction into planning, policy and practice. The WMO: stressed key components  to be strengthened, including provision of free and unrestricted exchange of,  and access to, climate data, climate service information systems and capacity  building; and highlighted that the Framework will provide an effective  interface between providers and users, in addition to building and  strengthening existing initiatives on observation, monitoring, research, modeling  and prediction.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">UNEP introduced  the Asia Pacific Global Climate Change Adaptation Network, launched on 3  October 2009, which aims to help vulnerable countries in the region enhance  their adaptive capacity by mobilizing knowledge and technology. Other  objectives include: helping build the climate resilience of human and  ecological systems; improving availability and accessibility of knowledge;  enhancing and disseminating information on adaptation; providing targeted  knowledge support to governments, planners and practitioners; enhancing  capacity of developing country institutions working on adaptation; and  improving coordination across regions. She also discussed activities including:  identifying gaps and needs in current knowledge and in critical sectors;  improving planning through assessment and development of tools and methods for  good adaptation practices; enhancing scientific capacity development for  vulnerability assessments; and training of trainers.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">The OECD outlined  ongoing activities, such as supporting the integration of adaptation into  development cooperation and conducting economic and policy analyses, including  on adaptation. He highlighted the OECD Policy Guidance on Integrating Climate  Change Adaptation into Development Cooperation, which provides a template for  adaptation integration and ongoing work to develop manuals to implement the  Guidance. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Resources for the  Future described their Global Adaptation Atlas, a web-based tool that is being  developed to map areas impacted by climate change and areas where adaptation  activities are taking place. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">FAO described  activities to assist countries to identify potential mitigation and adaptation  actions, particularly those applicable to particular situations, and mainstream  and include adaptation measures into food security programmes. He also  discussed work on developing guidelines for adapting crop systems and methods  to climate change. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">The ISDR  highlighted the second session of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk  Reduction meeting held in June, and also discussed support provided to DRR  experts in some developing countries to participate in ongoing climate change  negotiations.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Wetlands  International highlighted that their action pledge is being implemented through  their wetlands and livelihoods project. She said pilot projects, particularly  in Africa, demonstrate linking adaptation to  planning and processes. She also noted that they hope to incorporate some of  the key needs identified during this workshop into the capacity-building  modules being developed to launch sometime next year.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">WRI underscored  that the upcoming World Resources Report will focus on adaptation and that the  framework she introduced on the first day is almost ready to be piloted in  countries and could be used in baseline capacity assessments.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">In a brief  discussion, FAO noted that they will be developing a new tool to appraise the  adaptation potential of projects. In response to a question from Austria, Resources for the Future clarified that  their adaptation database will be launched at COP 15 in Copenhagen  in December.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory"><em><strong>SESSION 10: KEY MESSAGES AND CONCLUSION OF THE  WORKSHOP</strong></em></p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">During the afternoon,  the breakout group facilitators provided reflections and key messages from the  workshop. Nana K&uuml;nkel stressed conceptual and scientific work in the area of  integration and urged examining links in order to make activities more &ldquo;climate  proof.&rdquo; She also identified interest in legislative approaches to adaptation,  which could address dealing with uncertainty. William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu  identified three key messages: climate change adaptation is location-specific,  as are requirements for integration; adaptation is incomplete until the  necessary financial resources are in place; and good practices include  involvement of the local people. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Dawn  Pierre-Nathoniel stressed the necessity of integration and mainstreaming of  adaptation, cautioned against maladaptation, and advocated making appropriate  linkages and looking for opportunities for integration across sectors. She also  said the power of awareness must not be underestimated. Thomas Kolly stressed  that development is crucial and expressed hope that some of these discussions  would spill over into the negotiations. He said all stakeholders and sectors  should be included in the process, and that, while conditions vary by country,  there are lessons to be learned. He was pleased the workshop included both  negotiators and practitioners.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Amjad Abdulla  underlined the importance of engaging all sectors and all levels in adaptation  activities. He stressed that: adaptation is an ongoing activity; there is no  single design or activity that would be suitable in every situation; and  adaptation is an additional burden on developing countries.</p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">Chair Plume  highlighted that successful integration of approaches to adaptation planning  should aim to enhance synergy, coherence and consistency of processes and  objectives. She underlined the need for establishing partnerships to support  integration, and noted that challenges to integration are political, technical,  financial and institutional, including lack of awareness, capacity and  sufficient resources. Chair Plume also identified opportunities such as the use  of existing DRR practices and institutions, as well as NAPAs and national  communications. On priority areas, she noted information sharing, development  of tools and guidelines for integration, identification of appropriate entry  points, legislative and policy frameworks and stakeholder consultation. She  concluded by underlining that integration is an essential aspect of the  adaptation discourse and that its aim is to enhance adaptive capacity, reduce  vulnerability and enable climate-resilient development. </p>&#13;
                               <p class="textstory">The Secretariat  will produce a report of the workshop, which will be available on the  Secretariat&rsquo;s website. The Secretariat invited participants to a side event on  the NWP to be held at the resumed negotiating session in Barcelona, Spain,  on 3 November 2009, where partner organizations will present their activities  under the NWP. Chair Plume closed the workshop at 3:07 pm.</p>&#13;

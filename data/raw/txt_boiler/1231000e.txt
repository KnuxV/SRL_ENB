PLENARY
The COP met in Plenary to discuss Agenda Items 4(d) and 4(f), election of officers otherthan the President, and the Ministerial Segment. The President reported that consultationson the rules of procedure would continue as new proposals have been introduced.Application of the draft rules will continue until a consensus is reached. The followingdelegates were elected: Alexander Bedritsky (Russian Federation), Rene CastroHernandez (Costa Rica), John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda), Anthony Clark (Canada),Cornelia Quennet-Thielen (Germany), Tuiloma Neroni Slade (Samoa), and Abbas Naqi(Kuwait) as vice-presidents, and Antonio La Via (Philippines) as Rapporteur. SAUDIARABIA and KUWAIT expressed concern about the COPs failure to adopt rules ofprocedure and said that a compromise must be reached soon.
The upcoming ministerial segment will consist of three plenary sessions and one informalroundtable meeting to be chaired by Ruth Dreifuss (Switzerland). Plenary statements willbe limited to five minutes and entry to the roundtable will be restricted to heads ofdelegations at the ministerial level. SAUDIA ARABIA, supported by the REPUBLIC OFKOREA, the US, IRAN and BANGLADESH, objected to restricting the roundtable toministers, saying all heads of delegations should be welcome regardless of rank. To dootherwise would prejudice those delegations not able to send ministers. Increasedtransparency for the roundtable was also recommended. The President agreed to considerthe recommendations and report back to the COP.
AD HOC GROUP ON ARTICLE 13
The Ad Hoc Group on Article 13 met in the morning to discuss a multilateralconsultative process (MCP). Under Agenda item 3 (election of officers other than theChair), the Chair explained that the COP President is involved in discussions to agree on abalanced list for subsidiary bodies. Under item 4(a) (panel summary), the Chairrecommended that his report on a panel presentation become an annex to the Sessionreport. The US noted that elements are not listed in order of priority. Under item 4(b)(synthesis), participants adopted a synthesis of responses to a questionnaire on establishinga MCP under Article 13 (FCCC/AG13/1996/1) to be considered at the Groups Decembersession. The EU regretted that substantive discussions will be postponed until then. Herecommended a draft decision extending the AG-13 mandate to COP-3 and a role inexamining ways to apply a MCP to a protocol in cooperation with AGBM. Under item4(c) (draft decisions), the Chair recommended draft decisions on the continuation of AG-13 and inviting the Group to report to COP-3. The Chair accepted a Saudi Arabiaproposal to replace a reference to the possible design of a MCP with one on reporting tothe COP as instructed.
The meeting then considered the Chairs draft text on linkages between AG-13 andAGBM. The text stated that AGBM should take into account advice on a MCP, from AG-13, if it decides that such a process should apply to a protocol. Several delegationsobjected that referring to both a protocol and a MCP as part of this protocol prejudgedthe work of AGBM. Some delegations stated that other subsidiary bodies should beencouraged as well, though not required, to consult with AG-13 should they identify aneed for a MCP. Final wording of a redrafted text, as amended by SOUTH AFRICA andthe US, removes all reference to a protocol and asks the COP to decide that the AGBMmay, in its consideration of a MCP, seek such advice as may be deemed necessary fromAG-13.

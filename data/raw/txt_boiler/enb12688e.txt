HIGH-LEVEL EVENT ON ACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION
COP 22 President Salaheddine Mezouar opened the event.
President Hilda Heine, Marshall Islands, urged delegates to turn from celebration to implementation, and progress on mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stressed the power of partnership in multilateral climate negotiations and commended the two Global Climate Action Champions’ work, saying action is unstoppable.
Global Climate Action Champions Hakima El Haité and Laurence Tubiana announced the launch of the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, to provide a stable basis for governments and non-state actors to align their efforts in 2017-2020.
Tubiana said the Partnership aims to make the Action Agenda more coherent, robust and organized, including through a structured plan of meetings to yield tangible results.
El Haité welcomed the new Global Climate Action Champion Inia Seruiratu, Minister for Agriculture, Rural and Maritime Development and National Disaster Management, Fiji.
In the second part of the event, on recognizing progress and identifying opportunities, rapporteurs and panelists shared results from the Action Days held during COP 22.
On forests, speakers stressed the need for accelerated investment, integrated approaches on forests, land use and land management, and that “the forest agenda has to ensure indigenous land titles and their link to forests.”
Stressing that “water is climate and climate is water,” speakers underscored that “the time of easy access to water has ended,” and consumers and businesses have an important role in responsible water management.
On agriculture and food security, speakers noted Morocco’s Adaptation of African Agriculture initiative and an FAO initiative on water use efficiency, and stressed the need to address food waste and shift to responsible consumption.
On oceans, speakers underscored the need for integrated and scalable solutions providing food, risk prevention and other services, and the importance of investments in nature-based infrastructure solutions.
On business and industry, speakers highlighted 360 US businesses’ call to the current and incoming US administration to support the goals of the Paris Agreement, and called for, inter alia, financial disclosure, economic signals and long-term roadmaps.
On transport, speakers announced the launch of a global roadmap for accelerated action on transport, with the goal of reducing sectoral emissions from “7.7 gigatonnes to less than three in 2050.”
On cities and human settlements, speakers noted a roadmap for climate change and cities announced at a local and regional leaders’ summit in Marrakech, and called for global cooperation in standards and regulations.
On energy, speakers identified as action areas, inter alia: ambitious energy efficiency policies; scaling up energy efficiency investments; enabling frameworks for renewable energy; and commitments from investors.
Representatives of countries and groups announced: the European Fund for Sustainable Development; an initiative for scaling up renewable energy in SIDS; a partnership for sustainable electricity trade between Germany, France, Morocco, Portugal and Spain; and a pledge by Rwanda to ratify the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol in early 2017. Countries also highlighted New Zealand’s efforts on sustainable agriculture and livestock production, and Pakistan’s climate change bill and Green Pakistan Programme.
Opening the third part of the event, on providing and mobilizing finance for climate action, Nicholas Stern, New Climate Economy, stressed the next 20 years are the defining decades for sustainable, inclusive growth.
Panelists called for: deploying budgetary and fiscal policies for NDCs; leveraging public-private finance targets to move from billions to trillions; and allowing green savings to flow towards low-carbon and green initiatives.
Country representatives highlighted: the US$27 billion Dubai Green Fund; Hungary’s support to partner countries’ NDC implementation; and Germany’s Climate Action Plan 2050 and a new US$50 million contribution to the Adaptation Fund.
Other speakers drew attention to: the World Bank’s commitment to doubling finance for climate resilient and sustainable infrastructure, and increasing financing for adaptation; the Marrakech Investment Committee for Adaptation (MICA) Fund; and GEF actions catalyzed since Paris, including 60 mitigation and adaptation projects.
In closing remarks, COP 21 President Ségolène Royal congratulated participants and stakeholders for having taken up the Action Agenda with determination. Stressing that “governments alone cannot deliver the Paris agenda,” UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa called for wide dissemination of success stories. Frank Bainimarama, Prime Minister, Fiji, said he is aware of the responsibility his country is entrusted with in assuming the COP 23 Presidency.
COP CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS
MATTERS RELATING TO FINANCE: Report of the SCF and Review of the Functions of the SCF: Reporting back from consultations, Co-Chair Outi Honkatukia (Finland) said parties had found a way forward on the remaining paragraph to be agreed, related to the SCF integrating financing for forests-related considerations into its 2017 workplan. The contact group agreed to forward the draft decision to the COP.
Report of the GEF to the COP and Guidance to the GEF: Co-Chair Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) presented a proposal on the remaining paragraphs to be agreed: deleting a paragraph on any additional, newly mandated transparency and capacity building support not being diverted from existing programmes; removing brackets from a paragraph on following policies and procedures in the review of funding proposals; and clarifying a paragraph welcoming the GEF Council’s decision to ensure that support for the CBIT will be included in the seventh replenishment.
With these changes parties agreed to forward the draft decision to the COP.
Long-Term Climate Finance: Reporting on informal informals to the contact group, Co-Chair Andres Mogro (Ecuador) said parties agreed to a set of paragraphs, with the understanding that the draft decision is a “package.” He noted the need to focus on the paragraphs under “scaling up” in particular.
EGYPT, opposed by the US and EU, suggested that two paragraphs were repetitious: a paragraph welcoming developed countries’ progress toward the goal of mobilizing US$100 billion annually by 2020; and paragraph 1, welcoming submissions by developed countries in response to Decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 114 (enhanced provision of, inter alia, finance and a roadmap to US$100 billion). The Philippines, for the G-77/CHINA, and SAUDI ARABIA bracketed paragraph 1.
Co-Chair Georg Børsting (Norway) closed the contact group, saying he would deliver the draft decision to the COP Presidency as the “final product” of the group and report on the unresolved issues.

IN THE CORRIDORS
On Thursday, delegates retraced the steps they have taken up and down the Bab Ighli venue for the last ten days. Some delegates observed as the day wore on, that they also retraced their steps on several issues central to this week.
In informal consultations on the outcomes and decisions of the CMA, delegates’ views continued to differ, including on how to find a “home for orphan issues,” which are mandated by the Paris outcome, but not yet addressed under the Subsidiary Bodies. One delegate lamented that “some orphans are more impoverished than others,” advocating for equal treatment.
While parties’ views also differed on how to plan for the 2018 facilitative dialogue, when to reconvene CMA 1 and even whether to use the Presidency’s proposed decision as the basis of text, they agreed on the need for clarity on how to move forward. In this, they only heard that there would be a new text distributed “as soon as it is ready.”
Some decision texts concluded during CMP and COP plenaries, and participants were treated to a celebration of the Marrakech Action Proclamation, which at times had drawn consternation from groups of developing and developed countries alike. Inspired by another new acronym, some delegates hoped that it could serve as a MAP, through which the CMA negotiations could find their feet and step forward.

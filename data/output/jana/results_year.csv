93	1995	1217000e	['Canada']	The Chair said that no draft decision on technology transfer was yet available and asked the Philippines, on behalf of the G-77, and France, on behalf of EU, to produce a document in time for Tuesday's session of the COW. Estrada also said that no consensus was yet apparent on a means to decide on the location of the Permanent Secretariat. Various means have been considered, including an informal confidential survey of delegations' preferences by secret ballot, with an absolute majority deciding between the four offers. He said the original agreement was that a decision would be taken at Berlin and preferably prior to the ministerial session, but one of the four candidate delegations has insisted that the decision not be taken in Berlin. He said he recognized that the general feeling of the house was to take a decision at COP-1. Canada said its understanding was that there is no consensus on this point. The Chair said he would wait for Canada to support his proposal.
28	1995	1214000e	['Switzerland']	"Switzerland said Parties should prepare a protocol by 1997. She called foran ad hoc working group to conduct negotiations, adopt a mandate andschedule, and take a coordinated and cooperative approach to reductions. Theseapproaches could include emissions and energy efficiency standards for appliances,transportation fuel efficiency standards, transport taxes, and carbon and/or energytaxes. Hungary said negotiations on further measures should begin as soonas possible, with COP-1 deciding on a mandate for negotiations based on the EU""sproposal. Germany said a commitment to at least keep emissions at 1990levels after 2000 is a necessary step irrespective of other action on reductions. Animmediate framework for reductions is an urgent requirement. Delegates should adopta clear mandate as a starting point for protocol negotiations. He added that only ifindustrialized countries agreed to reductions could other States be expected to take oncommitments at an appropriate time."
599	1995	1215000e	['United States']	JOINT IMPLEMENTATION: The Chair introduced document A/AC.237/91/Add.1, which contains the text of proposals from the G-77 and China, the EU and the US. The Philippines, on behalf of the G-77 and China, reiterated points contained in their proposal submitted at INC-11, including the application of emission limits to only Annex I Parties and the distinction between joint activities and joint implementation. Brazil defined JI as a proposed system that allows industrialized countries to have developing countries reduce emissions in their place, and said that some developing countries will accept any terms rather than miss an opportunity for technological growth.
330	1995	1218000e	['United States']	"At the suggestion of France, a footnote was added to L.4 explaining that the workingcapital reserve amounted to 8.3% of the operating budget, equivalent to one month""sbudget. A US recommendation to change a reference in L.8 from a ""special voluntaryfund"" into a ""special fund"" was also agreed. The Executive Secretary indicated thatthe rules describe a special fund with voluntary contributions, but that the amendmentwould not make the contribution an assessed one. The documents were recommendedto the COP for adoption."
331	1995	1218000e	['United States']	An informal working group chaired by Mahmoud Ould El Ghaouth beganconsultations on joint implementation (JI) Tuesday afternoon. A drafting group ofabout 30 delegates began negotiations Tuesday night, working from a paper circulatedby the G-77 and the EU and US draft decisions from INC-11. The drafting group wasexpected to work late into the night.
174	1995	1216000e	['Canada', 'Switzerland']	"Consultations abound in the corridors and offices of the ICC. Amb. Estrada has been holding one-on-one informal consultations on joint implementation. By Saturday afternoon, it was still uncertain whether delegates would be able to reach consensus on a JI pilot phase or if Estrada would be able to produce a Chair's text or summary. Estrada informed delegates during the Saturday afternoon COW that these negotiations were moving ""very slowly,"" and that he did not expect to begin further consultations until the G-77 and China had been given additional time to condider the adequacy of commitments. Estrada has also been consulting with delegates from the four countries who wish to host the Permanent Secretariat (Canada, Germany, Switzerland and Uruguay) to try to reach agreement on a method to use to resolve this pending issue."
332	1995	1218000e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'Norway', 'United Kingdom']	"PLENARY: The Ministerial Segment will begin this morning at 11:00 amwith an address with German Chancellor Dr. Helmut Kohl. When the MinisterialSegment resumes at 2:00 pm, the speakers"" list for the six-hour session is expected toinclude ministers and other heads of delegations from the following countries: thePhilippines (on behalf of the G-77), France (on behalf of the EU), Norway, theEuropean Community, Algeria, the Netherlands, Poland, Papua New Guinea, theRussian Federation, Denmark, Venezuela, Germany, Argentina, Australia, Japan,Switzerland, Indonesia, Senegal, the United Kingdom, the United States, New Zealand,Mauritania, Myanmar, Canada, Malaysia, Mexico, Brazil, Luxembourg, Spain andMauritius."
684	1995	1213000e	['Russia']	"4(d) Election of Officers other than the President: The Presidentannounced the following nominations: Africa "" Mauritania and Zimbabwe; Asia ""India and Japan; Eastern Europe "" Hungary and the Russian Federation; LatinAmerica and the Caribbean "" Antigua and Barbuda and Argentina; Western Europeand Others "" Australia and Germany; and AOSIS "" Samoa. Kuwait and SaudiArabia expressed difficulty with Rule 22 on composition of the Bureau. They asked ifthe nominations for Vice-Presidents and the subsidiary bodies are still open, and addedthat they had asked to have OPEC countries represented on the Bureau. The Presidentsaid the COP would apply the Rules of Procedure, but there will still be negotiationson outstanding questions."
39	1995	1212000e	['Liechtenstein']	First review of national communications: To date, 24 Annex I Parties have submitted first national communications describing their efforts at implementing the Convention. In addition, the EC has sent an overview, Belgium has provided a summary, and Liechtenstein (not an Annex I Party) has sent in a national communication. Parties will assess this information and will need to decide on the process for future reviews.
683	1995	1213000e	['Russia']	"4(d) Election of Officers other than the President: The President announced the following nominations: Africa "" Mauritania and Zimbabwe; Asia ""India and Japan; Eastern Europe "" Hungary and the Russian Federation; LatinAmerica and the Caribbean "" Antigua and Barbuda and Argentina; Western Europe and Others "" Australia and Germany; and AOSIS "" Samoa. Kuwait and SaudiArabia expressed difficulty with Rule 22 on composition of the Bureau. They asked ift he nominations for Vice-Presidents and the subsidiary bodies are still open, and added that they had asked to have OPEC countries represented on the Bureau. The President said the COP would apply the Rules of Procedure, but there will still be negotiation son outstanding questions."
600	1995	1215000e	['Russia']	France, on behalf of the EU, called for a progressive approach beginning with a pilot phase that is transparent, well-defined and credible, with no credits for Annex I Parties. JI should not be used to impose new commitments on non-Annex I Parties. The Russian Federation said COP-1 should adopt criteria for JI. He called for equality of participation by all Parties. Costa Rica said that JI provides a possibility for enhancing renewable energy. She supported the participation of the private sector, emphasizing the need for transparency.
27	1995	1214000e	['Canada', 'Norway']	Norway noted that a protocol would avoid reopening the language of theConvention and advocated joint targets for OECD countries based on equitable sharingof responsibility. Canada asked Prof. Bolin if sulfate emissions should bereduced because aerosols produce a cooling effect. Bolin warned against attempts tobalance different emissions. Austria asked Bolin if reducing presentemissions was preferable to later reductions since technological advances will likelyallow easier reductions in the future. Bolin replied that innovations are not guaranteedand measures should not be postponed.
26	1995	1219000e	['Canada', 'Switzerland']	"At the beginning of the afternoon Plenary, Amb. Estrada, Chair of the COW, notedthat the final round of the survey on the location of the Secretariat would take place at3:00 pm. Canada then took the floor to withdraw Toronto""s candidacy to host thePermanent Secretariat. After the final speaker of the day, Estrada announced thatParties participating in the informal survey had selected Bonn as the location of thePermanent Secretariat. Switzerland expressed its regret and congratulated Germany.Germany stated it was aware of the responsibility accompanying the choice, andthanked Estrada and the delegates. The Executive-Secretary of the Interim Secretariat,Michael Zammit Cutajar, thanked Geneva for the hospitality extended since 1991."
685	1995	1213000e	['United States']	The US supported a suggestion by India and the EU to establish a smaller, open-ended group that would be a more appropriate forum for further discussion on this item. TheChair agreed and announced that the first meeting of this group would take place onWednesday evening.
38	1995	1212000e	['Canada', 'Switzerland']	The eleventh and final session of the INC met from 6-17 February 1995, at UN Headquarters in New York. During the two-week session, delegates addressed a wide range of issues including arrangements for the first session of the COP, location of the Permanent Secretariat, Rules of Procedure for the COP, matters relating to commitments, matters relating to arrangements for the financial mechanism, and provision of technical and financial support to developing country Parties. While delegates did agree to maintain the GEF as the interim entity operating the financial mechanism and to finance mitigation activities, little concrete progress was made on other important issues before the Committee. Delegates were unable to take action on the adequacy of commitments or to begin negotiations on a draft protocol submitted by AOSIS or the proposals for further elements of a protocol submitted by Germany. There was no progress on joint implementation. Delegates had little time to address technical and financial support to developing countries. The location of the Permanent Secretariat remains pending, although the four countries offering to host the Secretariat (Canada, Germany, Switzerland and Uruguay) have been asked to negotiate among themselves so that a single nomination is presented to the COP in Berlin. Finally, delegates were unable to reach agreement on the Rules of Procedure, a problem that will haunt the Parties at COP-1, who may find their substantive work hampered by the lack of agreement on voting procedures and the allocation of seats on the COP Bureau.
40	1995	1212000e	['Canada', 'Switzerland']	Institutional arrangements: The Parties must consider whether to extend or make permanent the interim arrangements for the financial mechanism, currently operated by the GEF. INC-11 recommended extending the interim arrangements. Additionally, the designation and location of the Permanent Secretariat and guidance for the work of the two subsidiary bodies, the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Science and Technological Advice (SBSTA), will have to be decided. Bids to locate the Permanent Secretariat have been made by Canada, Germany, Switzerland and Uruguay.
29	1995	1214000e	['United States']	"The US highlighted the IPCC""s contribution of scientific information. Hereflected on the US action plan to reduce emissions implemented approximately sixmonths ago, including a pilot programme on Joint Implementation. He said thatcommitments are inadequate because there was no guidance on action beyond 2000,but the global nature of the problem requires broad international participation. Headded that a drafting group should work on a mandate to begin a negotiating processwithin the SBI, with the SBSTA working on an assessment for limiting GHGs.Slovakia said that existing commitments will not meet the Convention""sobjectives and called for negotiations on a protocol to conclude in 1997-98 and forAnnex I Parties to take the lead."
329	1995	1218000e	['United States']	The US, supported by New Zealand, thought further discussion was necessary. Heasked if it was necessary to set the agendas for all future COPs in paragraph 3(a) andwho will provide the advice to improve the operational modalities for the effectivetransfer of technology in paragraph 3(b). After several additional proposals by China,the Netherlands, the US and the Republic of Korea, the Chair noted that the discussionmust come to an end, closed the debate and suggested that the Committee adopt thetext with the original compromise suggested by the Republic of Korea, on behalf ofthe G-77 and China, and accepted by the EU. Despite protestations by the US that itsconcerns had not been addressed, the Chair gavelled this matter to a close and the textwas adopted.
763	1996	1231000e	['United States']	The Ad Hoc Group on Article 13 met in the morning to discuss a multilateralconsultative process (MCP). Under Agenda item 3 (election of officers other than theChair), the Chair explained that the COP President is involved in discussions to agree on abalanced list for subsidiary bodies. Under item 4(a) (panel summary), the Chairrecommended that his report on a panel presentation become an annex to the Sessionreport. The US noted that elements are not listed in order of priority. Under item 4(b)(synthesis), participants adopted a synthesis of responses to a questionnaire on establishinga MCP under Article 13 (FCCC/AG13/1996/1) to be considered at the Groups Decembersession. The EU regretted that substantive discussions will be postponed until then. Herecommended a draft decision extending the AG-13 mandate to COP-3 and a role inexamining ways to apply a MCP to a protocol in cooperation with AGBM. Under item4(c) (draft decisions), the Chair recommended draft decisions on the continuation of AG-13 and inviting the Group to report to COP-3. The Chair accepted a Saudi Arabiaproposal to replace a reference to the possible design of a MCP with one on reporting tothe COP as instructed.
764	1996	1231000e	['United States']	The G-77/CHINA requested a postponement of discussion. The EU and the US welcomedthe GEF report, especially the operational strategy and its emphasis on enabling activities,and, along with POLAND, supported designation of the GEF as the permanent fundingmechanism. FRANCE cautioned that failure to approve the funding document mighthinder input from the COP to the next GEF replenishment. The Chair postponeddiscussion until Thursday.
767	1996	1231000e	['Canada', 'United States']	Delegates then considered activities implemented jointly under the pilot phase. TheSecretariat introduced an annual review of progress (FCCC/CP/1996/14 and Add.1). TheG-77/CHINA and the EU were not prepared to speak on the issue. CANADA saidSBSTA should not significantly change the reporting format at this session. She endorsedcontinuation at the pilot phase, with further assessment at COP-3. The US recommendedadoption of the Progress Report and Addendum as the first annual report on AIJ, andexpressed willingness to host the initial workshop on methodological issues as proposedby the Secretariat. She supported the formation of an AIJ forum, and suggested thatParties provide submissions for annual reports three months in advance. JAPAN suggestedstandard operational procedures for AIJ projects, monitoring and revision and supportedthe workshop on methodologies.
765	1996	1231000e	['Norway']	The EU suggested a draft decision on the need for voluntary contributions to support theSecretariats activities. Under Agenda item 3(a), the Secretariat introduced a compilationof national communications from Annex 1 Parties (FCCC/CP/1996/12 and Adds.1 and 2)and a report on experiences and results of the review process on submission ofcommunications (FCCC/CP/1996/13). The SBI was invited to consider the report in detailand convey conclusions to the AGBM and COP-2. In-depth reviews are available fromJapan, Spain and Norway. Reports from Denmark and the Netherlands will be availablesoon.
218	1996	1234000e	['United States']	"The US proposed that Annex II Parties separately provide information in accordancewith or on each of their commitments under Articles 4.3-4.5, rather than to fulfilltheir commitments. They should also provide information on measures taken to promote,facilitate and finance access as appropriate. The Co-Chair of the contact grouprecommended that Annex II Parties give effect to rather than ""fulfill"" theircommitments. The Co-chairs proposal was adopted. The US suggested that Parties carryout as supplemental information adjustments on inventory data. This proposal was laterwithdrawn at DENMARKs urging. The text for the guidelines was then adopted."
766	1996	1231000e	['Canada', 'United States']	SBSTA then considered Agenda Item 7 (mechanisms for consultations with NGOs). ThePresident introduced the relevant documents (FCCC/SBSTA/1996/11 andFCCC/SBSTA/1996/ Misc.2). The EU, supported by JAPAN, strongly supported the roleof NGOs and remained open to tailoring different mechanisms for different NGOconstituencies. The US said expanding access to only one type of NGO would beinappropriate and suggested strengthening existing channels. NEW ZEALAND urged thedevelopment of a special consultative mechanism for business NGOs as they will play avital role in implementation. CANADA supported a business consultative mechanism if itwill facilitate implementation and opposed open access to NGOs on the floor duringnegotiations.
229	1996	1233000e	['United States']	The Subsidiary Body on Implementation reconvened Friday morning to further considerAgenda Item 3(a) (communications from Annex I Parties). AOSIS regretted that only fourAnnex I Parties will reach 1990 levels in light of the SAR. Developed countries areplaying a deadly losing game. The impact of the Communications Synthesis(FCCC/CP/1996/13) is to discredit the initial goal in favor of limiting future goals towhatever national economic circumstances permit. The EU noted its concern that only sixout of twenty-one in-depth review reports have been finalized. The US noted theSecretariat's concern about time and resources needed for in-depth reviews. It isimperative that second communications be submitted by April 1997.
219	1996	1234000e	['Russia']	The RUSSIAN FEDERATION stated that the summary should be adopted at an officialsession with interpretation and that the text should reflect the exact language submitted bydelegations. KUWAIT disagreed with a reference to the SAR as a clear indication of thelikelihood of climate change, and noted that the optimum strategy for addressing theproblem will depend on the circumstances of each country. The EU said that individualmembers of the EU will make interventions on specific points.
220	1996	1234000e	['Canada', 'United States', 'Norway']	Following a brief consultation with the G-77/CHINA, Saudi Arabia and the EU, the Chairamended a reference to the SAR as an assessment, rather than a clear indication of thelikelihood of climate change. He added a sentence noting large cost differentials ofreducing GHGs among countries, and inserted a reference to areas such as agriculture,water resources and human health in regard to the socio-economic impacts on developingcountries. The US, the MARSHALL ISLANDS, the EU, CANADA, NORWAY, JAPANand AOSIS voiced concern that the text was not balanced and asked that their objectionbe noted on the record. The Chair stated it was useless to continue deliberations on thisissue.
17	1996	1229000e	['United States', 'Israel']	Parties proceeded to the adoption of the Agenda (FCCC/CP/1996/1). Under Item 4 (a) onNational Communications from Parties Included in Annex 1, the President reported thatthe United Republic of Tanzania and Qatar are to become signatories to the FCCC beforethe end of the Conference, and Israel will become a non-Annex 1 Party in August. TheCzech Republic, Morocco, and Slovakia have applied to become Annex 1 Parties.Introducing Agenda Item 4 (b), Adoption of the Rules of Procedure, the President said hewould conduct consultations to resolve the issue of rule 42 (voting). SAUDI ARABIAsaid agreement on rule 22 (election of officers) is also pending. Rule 22 should be limitedto regional group representatives. The President said each of the five regional groups areto be represented by two Bureau members and one Bureau member will represent thesmall island developing states (SIDS). SAUDI ARABIA objected to the nomination of aBureau member from Samoa to represent SIDS. The US said it was important to followprecedent in the election of officers to the Bureau and include the SIDS nominee. Partiesproceeded to the election of the Bureau. GERMANY said the SIDS were represented inthe Bureau of the INC in 1991. SAUDI ARABIA said he could not support the electionsas proposed. The President postponed the election of vice-presidents.
762	1996	1231000e	['Russia', 'Canada']	The COP met in Plenary to discuss Agenda Items 4(d) and 4(f), election of officers otherthan the President, and the Ministerial Segment. The President reported that consultationson the rules of procedure would continue as new proposals have been introduced.Application of the draft rules will continue until a consensus is reached. The followingdelegates were elected: Alexander Bedritsky (Russian Federation), Rene CastroHernandez (Costa Rica), John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda), Anthony Clark (Canada),Cornelia Quennet-Thielen (Germany), Tuiloma Neroni Slade (Samoa), and Abbas Naqi(Kuwait) as vice-presidents, and Antonio La Via (Philippines) as Rapporteur. SAUDIARABIA and KUWAIT expressed concern about the COPs failure to adopt rules ofprocedure and said that a compromise must be reached soon.
567	1996	1230000e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	Delegates began consideration of Agenda Item 4(a) (national communications of Annex IParties). The Secretariat introduced the document on possible revision of the guidelines(FCCC/SBSTA/1996/9). JAPAN, supported by the US, proposed a separate informalsession to discuss the revised guidelines. CHINA, supported by INDIA, highlighted theimportance of technology transfer and called for including language in the body of theguidelines. The EU approved extending the minimum information required andrecommended that the revised guidelines include direction for preferred timetables.POLAND and HUNGARY said second reports are being prepared and changingguidelines will lead to delays. SWITZERLAND proposed discussing amendments on aparagraph by paragraph basis. AUSTRALIA highlighted performance indicators.
18	1996	1229000e	['Russia', 'Canada']	Delegates then agreed on the admission of intergovernmental and non-governmentalorganisations as observers. Some delegations then returned to the election of officers andrequested clarification. The Executive Secretary stated that the COP had elected apresident in the morning session and, in the afternoon, heard nominations for 10 othermembers of the Bureau. For 6 of the 7 Vice-Presidents, delegates received thenominations of Alexander Bedritsky (Russian Federation) Rene Castro (Costa Rica), JohnAshe (Antigua and Barbuda), Anthony Clark (Canada), Cornelia Quennet-Theilen(Germany) and Tuiloma Neroni Slade (Samoa). Delegates also received the nominationsof Mohamed M. Ould El Ghaouth (Mauritania) as SBI Chair and Tibor Farago (Hungary)as SBSTA Chair. The representatives of the Asian Group presented nominations fromKuwait and the Philippines, but had not agreed which representative would serve asRapporteur and which as Vice-President. Delegates then discussed rule 22 as applied anda number of possibilities were put forward. It was suggested that the Parties elect the twoofficers for SBSTA and SBI. Regarding the other posts, he noted that the group now hasthe beginnings of a Bureau. He also noted that the two ad hoc groups, AGBMand AG13, already had chairs. SBSTA and SBI have only chairs and the COP has apresident. SAMOA questioned how the COP could proceed with only part of the Bureau.The President said that he will conduct consultations and resume the Plenary later todiscuss this item.
231	1996	1233000e	['Russia', 'United States']	POLICIES AND MEASURES: The session considered proposals for a protocolon policies and measures to implement FCCC. Debate centered on the pros and cons ofmandatory policies and measures and their market driven alternatives. The US said whileParties generally agree it is necessary to move forward, no single set of policies andmeasures could apply to all countries given diverging circumstances. He sought anindividual approach, noting the value of monitoring and reporting. The EU stated that acoordinated/mandatory approach would enhance progress by reducing participantsopportunity costs. He suggested categorization of policy measures and Party selection.The RUSSIAN FEDERATION called for categorization and prioritization.
232	1996	1233000e	['United Kingdom']	"The CZECH REPUBLIC sought assistance to countries with economies in transitionbecause their growth potential is substantial. URUGUAY called for solidarity and notedthat the COP continues to ""discuss the sex of angels"" while some countries are sufferingthe effects of inaction. The SIERRA CLUB stressed renewable energy projects rather thanrevenue intensive ones, coordinated fuel standards for vehicles and emissions targets.AUSTRALIA stated that the range of measures must be comprehensive and cautionedagainst selective sectoral processes in the absence of established criteria. NORWAYstressed sustainable production and consumption patterns and called on Parties to supportlifestyle changes. SAUDI ARABIA and IRAN supported a cooperative approach,particularly in addressing economic concerns, while the UK favored an individualistic one.KENYA recommended that policies and measures be market-driven."
506	1996	1235000e	['United States']	On the paragraph concerning the adoption of policies and measures, SAUDI ARABIAcalled for language noting the need for further studies. The EU proposed that action becoordinated rather than common or harmonized. KUWAIT said policies andmeasures should be assessed in terms of their economic costs and their impact ondeveloping countries. GERMANY and the US recommended that environmental costsand benefits be considered and EGYPT said their role in enhancing carbon sinks shouldalso be noted. The paragraph was adopted to reflect that several criteria were identifiedfor assessing policies and measures including their: potential to limit GHG emissions andenhance carbon sinks; economic costs and benefits; long and short term impact oneconomic growth in developing countries; and political feasibility as well as the need forcoordinated action.
507	1996	1235000e	['Canada', 'United States']	The Chair then proposed using the original text and noting that SBSTA took note of thetwo views on the SAR, rather than decides. Several delegations, including KUWAIT,CANADA, the MARSHALL ISLANDS, and the EU objected. The US, supported byAUSTRALIA, proposed language urging the COP to take a decision on the issue at thissession, and the EU objected.
233	1996	1233000e	['Russia']	QELROs: An afternoon Round Table considered Quantified EmissionsLimitations and Reduction Objectives (QELROs) with discussants from Germany, Japan,Samoa, the Russian Federation, the Philippines, and ABARE Commodity Forecasting andEconomic Policy Research. Supporters of targets proposed new GHG reduction targets of10% to 20% by 2005, and 15-20% by 2010, noted non-compliance with existingobjectives by developed countries, and suggested a purely cost-benefit approach will leadto further inaction. Others questioned the feasibility of a uniform reduction target orsuggested that the SAR demonstrates it is too early to judge limits and levels of reductionwithout an assessment of costs and benefits.
505	1996	1235000e	['United States']	The AGBM Chair invited comments on his Draft Conclusions (FCCC/AGBM/1996/L.2).The EU and Saudi Arabia objected to a reference to an equation to express linkagebetween policies and measures and QELROs. In a paragraph on elaboration of policiesand measures the US, supported by AUSTRALIA, objected to the inclusion of a menuapproach. FRANCE qualified a reference to harmonized policies and measures byprefacing the reference with and/or. GERMANY replaced mandatory with requiredapproach to policies and measures. AUSTRALIA incorporated sentences from the fourthparagraph, which notes the argument that no set of policies and measures may beappropriate for all Annex I Parties and concerns about competition.
564	1996	1230000e	['United States']	The Chair then introduced Agenda Item 7(b) on income and budget performance, andresource deployment for 1997 (FCCC/CP/1996/7 and Add.1). The Secretariat summarizedAdd.1 on the financial performance of the FCCC, contributions and expenditures in 1996,and the forecast for 1996-97. There will be an annual payment of DM1.5 million per yearfrom the German Government and lower staff costs arising from relocation to Bonn.Thirty-five Parties have paid contributions in full and expenditures are in line with COP-1estimates. Additional requirements for 1996 amount to US$158,000, and US$867,400 for1997. Germany will contribute an additional DM3.5 million annually to a special fund.Executive Secretary Michael Zammit-Cutajar noted that no additional core resources arebeing sought for 1997. He proposed a revision of the capital reserve level, up from 8.3%of the core budget to 15%. Responding to questions from the US and the EU, theSecretariat said budgeting beyond 1997 will be addressed at the next session of the SBI.No activity is given greater priority than in-depth reviews. JAPAN questioned theproposal to revise the level of working capital reserves. The Chair invited delegations tointeract with their capitals to resolve the issue. The SBI then recommended approval ofthe programme of work for 1996-1997 (FCCC/SBI/1996/11).
230	1996	1233000e	['United States']	The EU, supported by the US, suggested the Secretariat focus on voluntary private sectortechnology transfer and on enabling conditions for its transfer. The US recommendedreporting this in Annex I communications. CHINA stated that Annex II communicationsunder-emphasize technology transfer. BANGLADESH underlined the needs of LDCs.The MARSHALL ISLANDS highlighted technology adaptation. CHINA and EGYPTunderscored a governmental role.
339	1996	1232000e	['United States']	The Chair then introduced Agenda item 3 (national communications), including the secondcompilation of first national communications from Annex I Parties (FCCC/CP/ 1996/12and Add.1) and emission inventories and projections for 2000 (Add.2) and the reportingschedule (FCCC/CP/1996/13). The G-77/CHINA expressed concern that few developedcountries would reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. The RUSSIAN FEDERATIONcalled for expanded analysis of GHG emissions. The EU, supported by AUSTRALIA, saidthe documents are the principal source to assess progress. The US called for GHGemissions significantly below 1990 levels and policies beyond no-regrets actions.
566	1996	1230000e	['Russia']	COSTA RICA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, said a clear mechanism must be establishedfor the use of scientific information, and noted that SBSTA should not be selective whenpresenting information. He said that the SAR clearly indicates the negative potentialimpacts on developing countries. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said the SAR lacks aquantitative assessment of the permissible level of impact on the climate system. SAUDIARABIA, OMAN, KUWAIT, UAE, VENEZUELA, IRAN, NIGERIA and AUSTRALIAsaid it was premature to make recommendations given the lack of certainty in the SARdata. POLAND said that SBSTA should determine how scientific information may beutilized for the FCCC.
340	1996	1232000e	['Canada', 'United States']	On Agenda Item 8 (a) (roster of experts), the G-77/CHINA had not yet considered theitem and reserved its position. The EU supported establishing an interim roster of expertsto allow for a learning phase on providing specialized technical advice. He also acceptedthe addition of adaptation technologies to the list of potential subjects. CANADA, JAPANAUSTRALIA and AOSIS also supported the roster of experts. The RUSSIANFEDERATION said SBSTA should not focus on specific features and that the use ofscientific data is a basic question for the experts. KIRIBATI asked that fisheries bespecifically mentioned as a topic for consideration. The US said the issue should bedeferred until SBSTA clarifies the tasks for experts that do not duplicate the work ofother fora.
338	1996	1232000e	['Canada', 'Switzerland']	Several developed country delegations endorsed the Chairs text on the financialmechanism. SWITZERLAND and CANADA called for expedited funding for nationalcommunications. FRANCE suggested that Parties submit complaints about GEFperformance for review at future COP sessions. KENYA said many African countries areexperiencing excessive delays and linkage of projects to operational conditions notrequired by FCCC.
565	1996	1230000e	['Canada', 'United States', 'Norway']	The EU recalled that the preliminary views of delegations concerning the SAR wererecorded in the report of the last meeting. He urged the COP to endorse the SAR andaccept it as the most comprehensive assessment of available scientific information onclimate change. Many also expressed support for the SAR and made specific comments,including the US, CANADA, ARGENTINA, the REPUBLIC OF KOREA, COLOMBIA,NEW ZEALAND, BANGLADESH, NORWAY, FIJI, URUGUAY, MAURITIUS,JAPAN, BENIN, MYANMAR, BULGARIA and GREENPEACE. SAMOA, on behalf ofAOSIS, supported adoption of the SAR and noted the conclusion that SIDS are amongthe most vulnerable to climate change. This was seconded by MICRONESIA, theMALDIVES, the MARSHALL ISLANDS and NIUE.
508	1996	1235000e	['Canada', 'United States']	SBSTA also considered the draft decisions of the contact group on communications fromnon-Annex I Parties, which incorporates several additional responsibilities. BRAZIL saidthat the contact group decided that its work would not be prejudiced by the COPsdecision on guidelines for initial communications on the abatement of emissions. Severaldelegations, including CHINA, KUWAIT, INDIA, COSTA RICA, the PHILIPPINES,CANADA, the US and JAPAN, endorsed the decisions and acknowledged thecooperative efforts of non-Annex I Parties. The EU recognized the added responsibilitiesfor non-Annex I Parties. The PHILIPPINES also linked the expanded commitments ofnon-Annex I Parties to their potential role in obtaining funding.
342	1996	1232000e	['Canada']	The NETHERLANDS and the INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY described theClimate Technology Initiative, a cooperative effort to support the FCCC. CHINAsuggested the Secretariat prepare a proposal on the format for their communication fromAnnex II on technology transfer. CANADA said governments must provide an enablingenvironment for the private sector to facilitate technology transfer.
341	1996	1232000e	['Canada', 'United States']	SBSTA resumed in the afternoon to consider Agenda Item 8(d) (long-term work ofSBSTA). The Chair introduced text which was accepted. On Agenda Item 8(c)(cooperation with IPCC), several delegations including the EU, AUSTRALIA, US,CANADA, MYANMAR and MAURITIUS endorsed the IPCC. The RUSSIANFEDERATION encouraged clarification of SBSTAs relationship to the IPCC concerningthe use of data. BURKINA FASO called on the IPCC to expand research on regionalGHG emission limitations. The ICAO sought additional research on the atmosphericeffects of aviation. The Chair offered text on the item, which was accepted.
295	1997	enb1273e	['Norway', 'Switzerland', 'United States', 'Russia', 'Canada']	Antonio La Viña (Philippines) introduced a revised non- paper on sinks, containing only text relating to Option C of previous non-papers (accounting for limited sink activities to offset emissions). JAPAN, BARBADOS, RUSSIA, the US, CANADA, CUBA and JAMAICA supported the text. NEW ZEALAND, supported by AUSTRALIA, the US and NORWAY, called for an earlier text to be kept as an option for ministers. The Chair noted that the text had not been formally introduced, but agreed to keep it as a source. The MARSHALL ISLANDS, SWITZERLAND, BARBADOS and MALAYSIA objected. The US proposed adding “for the first commitment period” to a paragraph on when sink activities would be allowed. The EU put the whole paragraph in brackets. SAMOA, with TUVALU, signaled a possible reservation on the paragraph if other texts are left as options.
353	1997	enb1268e	['Canada']	The provisional agenda (FCCC/CP/1997/1), annotations on the organization of work (FCCC/CP/1997/1/Add.1), the list of documents (FCCC/CP/1997/1/Add.2), and a document on the high level segment (FCCC/CP/1997/L.1) were adopted. On election of officers other than President, delegates elected Bakary Kante SENEGAL) SBI Chair, a representative of IRAN SBI Vice Chair, George Manful (GHANA), T. Gzirishvili (GEORGIA), Anthony Clarke (CANADA), Cornelia Quennet- Thielen (GERMANY), Sergio Selaya Bonilla (HONDURAS), Luis Herrera (VENEZUELA), Kok Kee Chow (MALAYSIA) and Espen Ronneberg (MARSHALL ISLANDS), Vice Presidents, and Maciej Sadowski (POLAND) Rapporteur.
588	1997	enb1267e	['Russia', 'United Kingdom']	The UK asked that the distinction between the three-gas and six-gas approaches be maintained. HUNGARY supported using a three-gas basket, and addressing the three additional gases later. EGYPT reserved the right to consult within the G-77/China, which will provide a joint statement. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION preferred the three-gas approach at this stage. He said that if the basket includes more than three gases, then obligations must be considered further and there must be flexibility. TANZANIA highlighted the G-77/China proposal, which would call upon Parties to reduce emissions of three gases and make efforts to control and phase out the other three.
410	1997	enb1274e	['Iceland']	VENEZUELA, QATAR, KUWAIT, NIGERIA and SAUDI ARABIA called for a mechanism to compensate fossil fuel exporting countries for the economic losses resulting from the full implementation. SPAIN, PORTUGAL, GERMANY, GREECE and DENMARK noted their plans to cut emissions within the EU's overall plan. ICELAND said that renewable energy would have to play an increasing role.
411	1997	enb1274e	['Russia', 'Norway', 'United States', 'Iceland']	"Chair Estrada introduced a discussion on gas coverage. Recalling his ""three plus three"" proposal, he suggested a different base year for the second basket. The US, supported by NEW ZEALAND, proposed 1995. RUSSIA suggested dealing with the six gases basket in the second commitment period. ICELAND, supported by NORWAY and the EU, objected to the US proposal because some countries had already made efforts to reduce their emission of gases in the second basket. NORWAY asked whether those Parties with sufficient 1990 data on the gases in the proposed second basket could proceed with a full basket approach. INDIA said the G- 77/CHINA wished to revisit the issue after announcements on QELROs numbers."
408	1997	enb1274e	['Norway']	Many speakers focused on elements necessary for a Kyoto agreement. SAMOA, for AOSIS and supported by NIUE, stated that a Kyoto agreement must contain strong, short- and medium-term targets for Annex I Parties and a mechanism for early review of their adequacy. NORWAY said developed countries must agree on an overall reduction target for the emission of all GHGs of 10 to 15% by 2010. A flat rate approach fails in fairness and effectiveness, and renders an ambitious agreement impossible. SOUTH AFRICA supported the EU-proposed targets.
590	1997	enb1267e	['Russia']	He called for compromise on policies and measures, noting that some delegations are seeking a mandatory approach while others want none. The EU said it had made considerable concessions in Bonn by simplifying proposals on which policies and measures should be mandatory. EGYPT invited the Chair to present a balanced proposal. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION proposed a middle path consisting of national measures. He said the question of policies and measures is linked to other issues including the basket of gases to be adopted and the level of flexibility to be accorded to Russia and other countries with economies in transition. He urged delegations to begin seeking compromise immediately and not to leave all the negotiating work to government ministers. The EU tabled a new proposal, stating that any signatory or Party not included in Annex 1 nor acting under Article 10 may notify the depository that it has opted to adopt and implement some or all of the policies and measures and/or to participate in the coordination process referred to elsewhere in the protocol. The G-77/ CHINA objected to the inclusion of a reference to non-Annex I Parties.
352	1997	enb1268e	['Russia', 'United States']	He objected to the proposed “post-Kyoto evolutionary process” and to threats to aid unless developing countries accept it. The EU reiterated its position favoring: a 15% cut in emissions by developed countries, jointly or individually, by 2010; specific policies and measures (P&Ms); and consideration of new commitments for developing countries under Article 7.1(a) in the future. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION reiterated its proposal that each Annex I country consolidate its emissions into aggregate “carbon dioxide equivalents” with the obligations of each Annex I country set out in an attachment and determined according to Annex B. The US favored a target based on all GHGs, sources, and sinks, flexibility, and meaningful participation of key developing countries. She offered flexibility on limited, carefully bounded differentiation and proposed a working group to examine differentiation, including the Russian proposal. She noted concerns regarding the EU proposal for restrictions on emissions trading, the EU's target in light of its economic advantage under their bubble proposal, the breadth of differentiation implied, and EU member state accountability. She favored different targets for developing countries, such as emissions growth targets. Developing countries that assume voluntary commitments under the proposed Article 10 could gain new resources and technology through emissions trading.
409	1997	enb1274e	['Uzbekistan']	"VENEZUELA, CHINA and INDONESIA objected to emissions trading. FRANCE said flexibility alternatives should not be used until quantifiable reductions have been achieved. ARGENTINA, UZBEKISTAN and LITHUANIA supported JI as useful to access environmentally sound technologies. DENMARK said trading offers no end of possibilities for fraud and ""hot air"" trading should not be allowed. BRAZIL called for further consideration of emission trading permits between developed countries."
354	1997	enb1268e	['Russia', 'United States']	"The US delegation reportedly surprised the EU, not to mention a number of observers, with a call for a working group to look more closely at differentiation, including Russia's proposal, sometimes known as the ""big bubble."" The US statement raised the prospect that a variation of ""big bubble"" could surface in the QELROs negotiations. While some observers view the development as a possible ""way out"" for the US, permitting each party to choose its own reduction target, it is thought to be too early to judge the overall significance of this development. As it stands, the Russian formulation would transform the EU 15 percent reduction into a unilateral pledge, something the Europeans are expected to resist. Some participants predict that the EU may have to give some ground on differentiation."
7	1997	enb1272e	['Switzerland']	SWITZERLAND, supported by HUNGARY, urged SBSTA to further elaborate on the inclusion of bunker fuel emissions in overall GHG inventories.
8	1997	enb1272e	['Turkey']	On Review of information and possible decisions under Article 4.2(f), Pres. Oki (Japan) noted informal consultations on amendments to the Convention and its Annexes. Luis Herrera (Venezuela) reported consensus on replacing Czechoslovakia in Annex I with Slovakia and the Czech Republic and adding Croatia and Slovenia. He submitted a draft decision (FCCC/CP/1997/L.3), which was adopted. On deletion of Turkey from Annexes I and II, Herrera reported continuing consultations.
589	1997	enb1267e	['Norway', 'Switzerland', 'United States']	The US indicated that it had consistently advocated a comprehensive approach regarding the inclusion of a broad spectrum of GHGs within the scope of the protocol or legally binding instrument and, therefore, supported the proposal by the Chair to work on the basis of six GHGs, instead of three. NORWAY noted its support for the proposal by the Chair and said that methodologies were available to work on the basis of six GHGs. CHINA reiterated the G-77/China’s preference for a gas-by-gas approach. SWITZERLAND said that it originally made a proposal based on three GHGs, but favored the inclusion of all GHGs not covered by the Montreal Protocol, including HFCs, PFCs, and SF6. POLAND suggested that additional GHGs could be included at a later stage. BRAZIL noted that long-lived gases required the attention of the AGBM and hoped that consensus could be reached in this respect.
289	1997	enb1273e	['United States']	Article 14(i) contained two alternatives on the rules of procedure and the financial rules. The US supported Alternative B, under which the MOP would adopt rules of procedure and financial rules by consensus. The G-77/CHINA said that during informal consultations, it had combined its proposal with the EU's and produced Alternative A, under which the rules of the Convention apply to the protocol mutatis mutandis except as may otherwise be decided by consensus by the COP. Following a proposal by the Chair, delegates adopted Alternative A.
10	1997	enb1272e	['Canada', 'United States']	HUNGARY said other Parties could follow countries with economies in transition, who joined Annex I in spite of economic difficulties. The US stated that commitments for all Parties must allow for economic growth while simultaneously protecting the environment. The US wants developing countries, except least developed countries, to adopt emissions targets that seek to abate the increase in their emissions. He noted that developing country commitments could be differentiated in light of respective responsibilities and capabilities. The EU reiterated that the Berlin Mandate precludes new developing countries commitments and underscored that developed countries must lead by adopting legally binding commitments in Kyoto. He said it would be appropriate to start a review process based on Article 7.2 with a view to establishing further commitments for all Parties. While acknowledging efforts by developing countries to address their emissions, JAPAN pointed to the need for further participation in the future. He proposed initiating a post-Kyoto process to this effect. He said that developing country participation does not mean reduction, but limitation of emissions and indicated that New Zealand’s proposal could serve as a basis for discussions. CANADA said that the sequencing of commitments had worked under other agreements.
6	1997	enb1272e	['Norway']	On Article 4 (the EU “bubble”), NORWAY reported consultations had made progress by clarification and concession from the EU and the proposal would be amended. He said important issues are still outstanding. On Article 10 (voluntary commitments), MEXICO reported that delegates had expressed an interest in cooperating on the issue, but there were no indications that all regional groups are interested in contact group discussions.
9	1997	enb1272e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'United States']	"NEW ZEALAND said Annex I Parties’ constituencies need assurances that developing countries will adopt binding emissions limitation commitments in a third commitment period. He proposed double conditionality: Annex I Parties need early agreement by non-Annex I countries on future commitments, but non-Annex I Parties would not be held to commitments if Annex I Parties do not fulfil their Kyoto commitments. He called for ""progressive engagement"" according to relative levels of development, and exemption for least developed countries. Supported by HUNGARY, the US, CANADA, the EU, POLAND, SLOVENIA, AUSTRALIA, SWITZERLAND, and JAPAN, he introduced a draft text that, inter alia: notes Annex I Party commitments through 2014; considers that future Annex I commitments beyond that date should comprise the widest possible participation in binding action; recognizes the dependence of inception of non-Annex I Parties’ legally binding emissions limitations commitments on Annex I Parties' implementation, particularly of Kyoto Protocol QELROs; agrees there should be further QELROs for Annex I Parties and “quantified emission limitation objectives” for other Parties, except least developed countries; and establishes a process to set the commitments, to be concluded by 2002."
412	1997	enb1274e	['Russia', 'United States', 'Ukraine']	"The US said its number is a package, depending on what gases are included, how sinks count, and what kinds of flexibility are available. If there is no trading, the number changes. He proposed an additional paragraph extracted from Article 7 (Joint Implementation) permitting projects between Annex 1 parties. The EU said the scope of flexibility, including emissions trading, was contingent upon QELROs numbers. COLOMBIA said the ability to display flexibility had just about run out among non-Annex I countries. SAMOA suggested that the provision of a range of numbers would assist the debate on emissions trading. UKRAINE defended retaining Articles 6, 7 and 8 because they define the mechanisms for implementation. RUSSIA supported a proposal from the Chair to close discussion, and suggested a protocol between the EU and G-77/CHINA. UGANDA said there would be no ""free"" trading of emissions. Chair Estrada announced his intention to produce a paper with a proposed final approach, with QELROs numbers and positions. The deadline for Parties to deliver their own numbers would be 3:00 pm Tuesday."
293	1997	enb1273e	['Canada', 'United States', 'United Kingdom']	John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda), Chair of the working group on Article 13 on finance reported disagreement over bracketed references to provision of financial resources “through the financial mechanism” defined by Article 11 and over guidance to the mechanism. The PHILIPPINES, for the G- 77/CHINA, proposed deletion of the text in brackets. The UK, for the EU, and supported by the US, CANADA and JAPAN, said it was necessary to specify the financial mechanism to avoid any ambiguity. Chair Estrada, supported by NIGERIA, suggested deletion.
294	1997	enb1273e	['Russia', 'Canada', 'United States']	On sinks, Chair Estrada asked for informal consultations to consider several questions including, inter alia, a proposal that a subsidiary body could work on sinks in June 1998, and report to COP-4 prior to entry into force of the protocol. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said the nature of the issue’s resolution would determine his view of the protocol. The MARSHALL ISLANDS, COSTA RICA and URUGUAY said they were ready to adopt the existing draft text. CANADA said there is an inconsistency in the proposal’s treatment of harvesting, which would cause Canada “enormous pain,” and reforestation, which would not offset the penalty from harvesting. MEXICO asked the Chair to include conservation activities in the consideration of a definition of sinks. Chair Estrada said that the necessary analysis and definitions were not yet available. The US said the text might not be resolved until calculations regarding targets had been completed. Chair Estrada said his suggested definitions would point to lower numbers. It was best to be clear and transparent on what Parties were planning to do and adopt common standards. The EU urged caution to avoid perverse incentives.
185	1997	enb1275e	['Kazakhstan']	Many countries, including KAZAKHSTAN, EGYPT, ZIMBABWE, ZAMBIA, MALAWI, CAMBODIA, SOLOMON ISLANDS, LAOS, URUGUAY, VIET NAM, GAMBIA, KENYA, TUNISIA, MYANMAR, NIGER, UGANDA, MOROCCO, LESOTHO, SWAZILAND emphasized the need for technology transfer, financial resources and capacity building to address climate change. Some countries, such as PERU, CHILE and COLOMBIA, supported a clean development fund. BELGIUM called for a more equitable way of sharing technologies between North and South.
290	1997	enb1273e	['Norway']	"NORWAY summarized the draft on Article 4, the EU ""bubble."" He noted an impasse on two alternatives, one from the EU and one from other contact group members. The second alternative emphasizes that allocation of emissions under the ""bubble"" would be legally binding. Another section would cap rearrangements of allocations, and text is included to take account of changes in or enlargement of regional economic integration organizations."
291	1997	enb1273e	['Canada', 'United States']	"IRAN reported on negotiations on minimizing the adverse effects of climate change through policies and measures. He proposed alternative text based on a draft decision by Zimbabwe and Uganda calling for an SBI review of actions to meet developing country needs-related adverse effects. Both contain a bracketed reference to [establishment of measurements of compensation]. The US, the EU, POLAND, AUSTRALIA, and CANADA said compensation was unacceptable and the paragraph should be deleted. SAUDI ARABIA, the G- 77/CHINA, INDONESIA, UGANDA, URUGUAY, KUWAIT, NIGERIA, the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, CHINA, VENEZUELA, BAHRAIN and EGYPT supported removing the brackets. ZIMBABWE suggested ministerial consideration of the proposal under FCCC Article 4.8. NEW ZEALAND objected to compensation, but supported Uganda's proposal to replace ""compensation"" with ""impacts."" The Chair suggested replacing the existing paragraph with Iran's text, with the entire text bracketed."
292	1997	enb1273e	['United States']	Bo Kjellén (Sweden), Chair of the working group on Article 12, reported that numerous alternative texts remained to be decided. A document was distributed outlining the status of negotiation, including alternative texts and some new proposals. Chair Estrada invited Parties to negotiate on the basis of Kjellén’s alternatives. The US introduced a new proposal on the transfer of environmentally sound technologies (ESTs).
184	1997	enb1275e	['Turkmenistan', 'Kazakhstan']	Other speakers, such as KAZAKHSTAN, NIGER, VIET NAM, KIRIBATI, EGYPT, JORDAN, LEBANON, ECUADOR, URUGUAY, LESOTHO, KENYA, BAHRAIN, TURKMENISTAN and SLOVENIA recounted the effects of climate change and national efforts to address these problems and lower GHG emissions. BHUTAN noted its effort to maintain its forests as carbon sinks. FIJI stated that island states would experience the worse effects of climate change. CUBA noted that even under an unfair economic blockade it has taken action on climate change as a small island developing country.
135	1997	enb1271e	['United States']	A number of the key elements in a final agreement are the subject of bilateral and multilateral contacts on the fringes of the negotiation. One important example is the bilateral contact between the US and Brazil to discuss the fate of the proposed clean development fund. Observers believe that the US has come to view the initiative as the key to a neat fix, linking a number of their interests, including emissions trading, and engaging some developing countries in meaningful participation with the promise of generating funds for technology. Asked about the US interest in the clean development fund, an EU representative warned that multiple loopholes would render targets meaningless.
155	1997	enb1269e	['Canada']	Canada said that delegates must come away from Kyoto confident that key developing countries, especially those whose emissions are large and growing, will ultimately be part of a processs leading to a solution. Developing countries should take care not to feed ammunition to those people who would cite their arguments as an excuse for doing nothing. Canada stated that equivalency of effort is an important objective if their target must be “sold” domestically. An acceptable way to appropriately recognize national circumstances must be found, and differentiated targets could be included. He said that while the EU’s wish to act jointly is understandable, he remains unpersuaded that this approach would be equitable. A major problem inherent in the EU “bubble” approach is its allowance for wide differentiation of targets within the EU, while denying differentiation to others. The effect of future additions of EU member states also presents a problem.
186	1997	enb1275e	['Armenia', 'Azerbaijan Democratic Republic']	LATVIA said Annex I countries should lead the process of GHG reduction, but developing countries should demonstrate the political will to follow. SLOVAKIA agreed to commit to reductions even if its economy is not highly developed. ESTONIA said advanced developing countries should begin adopting some commitments. THAILAND supported dividing developing countries into two groups with different timeframes for reaching targets while calling for support and leadership from developed countries. AZERBAIJAN, ARMENIA and CROATIA said difficulties in the transition to a market economy should be taken into account.
134	1997	enb1271e	['Russia', 'Norway']	Harald Dovaland (Norway) reported on informal consultations conducted on the European “bubble” contained in Article 4 and said that further clarifications were needed on the meaning of terms within the article. He said that the EU was trying to find ways to accommodate delegations’ concerns. Chair Estrada urged the group to continue its consultations in order to report on progress to the COP as soon as possible. The EU stated that it would not be in a position to continue consultations until the Ministers arrived, given the significance of the issue for the EU. Chair Estrada ruled that he would not wait for the high- level segment and would proceed to submit existing proposals for decision by the COP. The Russian Federation supported the Chair’s ruling.
188	1997	enb1275e	['Kazakhstan']	KAZAKHSTAN, SLOVENIA, LATVIA and ESTONIA supported emissions trading but emphasized strong monitoring and compliance mechanisms. POLAND called for a budget approach to allow countries that reduce emissions before 2000 to bank those credits against later emissions. MALAWI, URUGUAY, ETHIOPIA, COLOMBIA and ROMANIA welcomed activities implemented jointly (AIJ). CAMBODIA said emissions trading and joint implementation (JI) could be useful if focused on clean technology dissemination. The PHILIPPINES cautioned against using sinks, emissions trading and JI.
189	1997	enb1275e	['Norway', 'Ukraine', 'Iceland', 'United States', 'Russia', 'Canada']	Delegates indicated that a number of major issues were still in play after the adjournment of the COW early Wednesday. A revised sinks text was reportedly circulating. Several delegations suggested they were not yet ready to accept the quantified emission limitation and reduction commitment in the Chair's draft Annex A, which put the EU at -8 percent, the US, Russia, Canada and Ukraine at -5 percent, Japan at -4.5 percent, New Zealand even, Australia and Norway at +5 percent, and Iceland +10 percent compared to 1990 levels. Delegates are also thought to be re- crafting the proposal on evolution, a follow-up to New Zealand's bid to get developing countries on board.
739	1997	enb1270e	['United States']	"Formulae for differentiation have begun to proliferate, with at least two suggestions that would form a number of groups or categories among Annex I parties. A Japanese delegate said Japan's proposal for three categories is under active consideration. The proposers have, however, distanced themselves from suggestions that their proposal would set a reduction target for the US at 3.5 % and for the EU at 7.5 %. The EU has indicated that it will not settle for a higher target than the US. The EU's position on differentiation is that Parties should follow the EU ""bubble"" example and form burden sharing groups. For example, a number of EU spokespersons have suggested that the US could join its NAFTA partners. The US has not yet detailed its preferred approach to differentiation."
738	1997	enb1270e	['United States']	"Under Kuwait's proposed amendment, Parties shall provide financial resources, including the transfer of technology, as the COP may decide they are needed by the developing country Parties. Kuwait said the developing countries can only lower emissions through technology, but resources made available to date have been inadequate. The EU, supported by the US and JAPAN, said donors should not place their resources in the hands of the COP. SAUDI ARABIA said the amendment came in reaction to the EU proposal, which upsets the Convention's ""delicate balance."" NIGERIA said linkages between the two proposals must be considered. Bakary Kante (Senegal) will conduct informal consultations."
736	1997	enb1270e	['Turkey', 'United States', 'Azerbaijan Democratic Republic']	On Item 3(e), Review of information and possible decisions under Article 4.2(f), delegates agreed on the proposal that Croatia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia replace Czechoslovakia in Annex I. Delegates debated at length a proposal by Azerbaijan and Pakistan to delete Turkey from Annex I and Annex II. IRAN, TURKEY and KUWAIT supported the proposal. The EU and AUSTRALIA maintained that Turkey should indicate willingness to undertake Protocol obligations under Article 10 before its deletion from the Annexes. The US suggested continuing consideration of this proposal and other OECD members relationship to Annex I at COP-4. TURKEY noted that questions remain unanswered on the Protocols proposed Article 10 and requested that ministers discuss the matter on 10 December. The Chair proposed that Luis Herrera (Venezuela) undertake consultations on these amendments.
187	1997	enb1275e	['Monaco']	AUSTRIA and ITALY described their target within the EU proposal. AUSTRIA said the number of outstanding issues underscores the need for a follow-up process. ITALY highlighted domestic increases in renewable energy investments. FINLAND highlighted its actions on climate change and called national actions the most critical. IRELAND noted that its indicative emissions target for 2010 represents a 15% increase over 1990 levels rather than the 55% increase that would be realized otherwise. The CZECH REPUBLIC and MONACO supported the EU's targets and policies and measures for achieving them.
737	1997	enb1270e	['Russia']	The EU said objections to the protocol may remain at the end of COP-3 and a decision-making procedure would be needed. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION emphasized that voting is not the way to adopt an important international instrument. VENEZUELA said the amendment and its provisional application must be considered separately. Sergio Alejandro Zelaya Bonilla (Honduras) will conduct informal consultations.
395	1998	enb1288e	['Norway']	Regarding the election of officers, the following delegates were elected: Papa Cham (the Gambia); Mohamed Al Sabban (Saudi Arabia); T. Gzirishvili (Georgia); Harald Dovland (Norway); Ole Ploughmann (Denmark); Espen Rnneberg, (Marshall Islands); John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda); Bakary Kante (Senegal); Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia); and Maciej Sadowski (Poland).
159	1998	enb1296e	['United Kingdom']	The UK, with GHANA, said scientific uncertainty should not be used as an excuse for inaction. DENMARK called for a Buenos Aires deal that calls upon developed countries to commit themselves to provide additional funds to developing countries and address their obligations under the FCCC and the Protocol. In return, developing countries must agree to work out the necessary national strategies to allow for a constructive review process. AOSIS called for a clear and ambitious timetable to elaborate the Protocol. The G-77/CHINA said their participation in mitigating climate change depends on the effective implementation of developed country Party commitments in the field of technology transfer and financial resources. JAPAN and the EU stressed the need to maintain the momentum of Kyoto, and with FINLAND, called for the creation of a clear and efficient work plan giving priority to developing country concerns. LATVIA supported the EU proposal for a Buenos Aires work plan.
467	1998	enb1294e	['United States']	The joint SBSTA/SBI session discussed the review of progress under the pilot phase of AIJ, Protocol Articles 6, 12, and 17, and preparations for COP/MOP-1. On the review of progress under the AIJ pilot phase, Chair Cornelia Quennet-Thielen (Germany) presented a draft decision (FCCC/SB/1998/CRP.3) based on informal consultations. The G-77/CHINA opposed text on crediting for AIJ pilot phase projects and proposed an amendment on continuing the AIJ pilot phase, focusing on developing countries. The US and SLOVENIA opposed the change, noting it excluded certain groups of Parties. AUSTRALIA said incentives were needed for the private sector. The draft decision was forwarded to Plenary.
303	1998	enb1289e	['Norway', 'Switzerland', 'United States']	SWITZERLAND, with NORWAY, JAPAN, SLOVENIA, the EU, the US, AUSTRALIA and COLOMBIA, contended that the AIJ pilot phase provided lessons for the flexibility mechanisms. A review of the AIJ pilot phase for COP-5 will support the development of this work. POLAND observed that a review of the process could explain why some countries are excluded and resolve some of the concerns of the G-77/CHINA. After an extensive debate, the co-chairs indicated that informal negotiations would be held on this matter.
317	1998	enb1290e	['Switzerland']	The EU stated that the mechanisms should be developed parallel to and consistent with each other. He said domestic actions should be the primary means of emissions reductions and the mechanisms should be supplemental. He called for the definition of a quantitative and qualitative ceiling based on equitable terms. SWITZERLAND suggested the creation of a compliance mechanism. The EU, SWITZERLAND and SLOVENIA said COP- 4 should agree on as many principles as possible and adopt detailed schedules on enacting the Kyoto Protocol. AUSTRALIA said the flexibility mechanisms were to be open, market-based, transparent, cost effective and equitable; provide comprehensive coverage, including sinks; and be fungible. With NEW ZEALAND, she opposed restrictions on trade in assigned amounts, characterizing them as inequitable, costly, arbitrary and difficult to implement.
394	1998	enb1288e	['Russia']	The RUSSIAN FEDERATION reminded delegates that within 15 years, emissions from non-Annex I countries would exceed those of Annex I countries. The CZECH REPUBLIC, with HUNGARY and SLOVENIA, supported the inclusion of Item 6 and noted that it could foster useful debate and dialogue. POLAND said if Parties wanted to adhere to FCCC goals, they should be encouraged to assume voluntary commitments. This dialogue would reflect the dynamic situation in the global economy and changes within Parties.
301	1998	enb1289e	['Canada', 'United States']	On the schedule of meetings for 2000-2001, the EU, supported by CANADA and AUSTRALIA, proposed that COP-5 be held in 2000 rather than 1999. With SAUDI ARABIA, CHINA, VENEZUELA and NIGERIA, MAURITANIA objected to this proposal. If the COP is postponed, he said governments might not feel the pressure to ratify the Protocol. CHINA noted that several issues under the Convention remain unresolved and time is needed to prepare for the Protocols entry into force. NIGERIA objected to the US proposal for alternating ministerial and non-ministerial COPs. CANADA called for consultations on this issue under the guidance of the Chair.
158	1998	enb1296e	['Norway']	FRANCE noted that developing country emissions are increasing and called for timely provision of financial support and technology transfer. With ECUADOR, FINLAND, the CARICOM states, the GAMBIA, VENEZUELA, CHINA, ECUADOR, BENIN, TANZANIA and UGANDA, he highlighted the need for additional financial support, sustained transfer of information and technology, capacity building and institutional strengthening. SUDAN stressed technology transfer irrespective of political relations or racial considerations. NORWAY recognized the role of industry in technology transfer. The NETHERLANDS highlighted the need for increased financial flows to the most vulnerable countries.
161	1998	enb1296e	['United States', 'Iceland']	GHANA said the challenges of climate change mitigation and adaptation present an additional burden to developing countries and with the CARICOM states, ICELAND, AUSTRALIA, the US, SAUDI ARABIA, NEW ZEALAND and the G-77/CHINA called for elaboration of mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol. The CENTRAL AMERICAN STATES stressed the importance of sinks and supported the G-77/China proposal to prioritize the CDM and operationalize it by 1 January 2000. With CHILE, he proposed an interim phase of the CDM. IRELAND supported the EU call for clear qualitative and quantitative ceilings on the use of the flexibility mechanisms. The COOK ISLANDS, MARSHALL ISLANDS, NAURU, NIUE, TUVALU, ALGERIA and the CARICOM States expressed concern that the flexibility mechanisms are a way of avoiding domestic responsibility. THAILAND said the CDM should not be the sole means of technology transfer.
319	1998	enb1290e	['Turkey']	Delegates considered the review of information and possible decisions under Article 4.2(f), which addresses amendments to FCCC Annexes (FCCC/CP/1998/13; FCCC/CP/1997/MISC.3). The Chair recalled that informal consultations were held during the last two sessions but no consensus emerged. PAKISTAN requested Parties to delete Turkey from Annex I. TURKEY said it remained unable to sign the FCCC while in Annex I. The EU said all OECD countries should have legally binding targets. Informal consultations will be held .
298	1998	enb1289e	['Canada']	MARSHALL ISLANDS, supported by BRAZIL, BARBADOS and TUVALU, said the draft decision would lead to special dispensations prior to the Kyoto Protocols entry into force and could create an incentive for emissions increases in Annex I countries. With AUSTRIA, CANADA and BARBADOS, he requested more time for consultations. AUSTRALIA recognized the impact of special projects on small economies and supported establishing guidelines and methodologies to specify circumstances under which special projects could be accommodated. CANADA and BRAZIL said the draft decision could set a precedent affecting the integrity of the Protocol. BRAZIL noted that the Kyoto Protocol provides for mechanisms enabling Annex I Parties to seek lower- cost alternatives for emission reductions.
300	1998	enb1289e	['United States']	On the Scientific and Methodological Aspects of the Proposal from Brazil, BRAZIL described it as the allocation of responsibilities among different emitters based on their actions as measured by the increase in global temperatures rather than by emissions. INDONESIA supported discussion of the issue. GEORGIA stressed that monitoring of GHGs needed enhancement. The US said that using temperature change as the sole indicator of responsibility ignored relevant socio-economic factors. The EU supported the thoughtful Brazilian proposal.
299	1998	enb1289e	['United States', 'Iceland']	The US said the differentiation in assigned amounts in the Protocol allows for differences in national circumstances. He stated that Icelands draft decision was consistent with the Protocol. ICELAND noted that this issue was identified at COP-3, and raised it now to facilitate its ratification of the Protocol. He distinguished between significant proportional impacts resulting from planned projects, and unexpected events. The Chair asked Ole Ploughmann (Denmark) to conduct consultations and prepare a draft decision for SBSTA.
604	1998	enb1287e	['United States']	MEETINGS OF THE FCCC SUBSIDIARY BODIES: The subsidiary bodies of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) met from 2-12 June 1998 in Bonn, Germany. These were the first formal FCCC meetings since the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol at the Third Conference of the Parties (COP-3) in December 1997. The eighth session of SBSTA (SBSTA-8) agreed to draft conclusions on, inter alia, cooperation with relevant international organizations, methodological issues, and education and training. The eighth session of SBI (SBI-8) reached conclusions on, inter alia, national communications, the financial mechanism and the second review of adequacy of Annex I Party commitments. In its sixth session, the Ad Hoc Group on Article 13 (AG13) concluded its work on the functions of the Multilateral Consultative Process (MCP). After joint SBI/SBSTA consideration and extensive contact group debates on the flexibility mechanisms, delegates could only agree to a compilation document containing proposals from the G-77/China, the EU and the US.
160	1998	enb1296e	['Russia', 'Norway', 'United States']	NEW ZEALAND, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and the US supported the Argentine voluntary commitment. With the US and HUNGARY, AUSTRALIA called for meaningful participation and future voluntary commitments appropriate to individual circumstances and with QATAR, NORWAY, PERU and SENEGAL stressed the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.
157	1998	enb1296e	['Russia', 'Norway']	A number of countries, including the EU, GAMBIA, JAPAN, SWEDEN, SYRIA, CROATIA, NEW ZEALAND, RUSSIAN FEDERATION, EGYPT, NEPAL SPAIN, GHANA and the G-77/CHINA, stressed that: active leadership to prevent global warming must come from developed country Parties; domestic action must provide the main means for meeting commitments to combat climate change; and noted that flexibility mechanisms were supplemental and their use must be subject to strict rules of accountability and compliance. PERU said the inaction of developed countries sends dangerous signals to non-Annex I countries. NORWAY said developed countries must accept even more ambitious targets in the future. Recognizing the vulnerability of small island states, NEW ZEALAND called for support to AOSIS.
320	1998	enb1290e	['Norway', 'Switzerland', 'United States', 'Russia', 'Canada']	NORWAY, with the EU, AUSTRALIA, the US and CANADA, stated that: the national communications and their review were important to the Convention process; reporting issues and guidelines require increased attention; and the Secretariat should conduct more analytical work. The EU, NEW ZEALAND, the US, SWITZERLAND, CANADA and NORWAY said the third national communication should be due in 2001. The EU, NORWAY and the US supported the Secretariat's proposed paper on comparison of activity data, but sought clarification on several technical and procedural issues. A contact group co-chaired by Alexander Metalnikov (Russian Federation) and Mahmoud El Gaouth (Mauritania) will consider the issue.
321	1998	enb1290e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	The EU said communications should be considered on a country- level basis and more frequent workshops would be beneficial. SWITZERLAND and AUSTRALIA underscored that non-Annex I communications undergo a review process similar to Annex I. Dan Reifsnyder (US) will chair a contact group on this issue.
456	1998	enb1293e	['Russia']	The RUSSIAN FEDERATION suggested deleting the requirement of a Report from the Secretariat, as the IPCC Report could provide the required information. The Chair clarified there would be two separate reports and was confident Parties would be able to reach credible conclusions. The CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC proposed deleting the requirement for the Secretariat to compile the conclusions of the joint workshop. The EU and CHINA opposed the suggestion as it would mean additional work for the IPCC. The Chair clarified that the Secretariat was only to compile the information provided and not rewrite the IPCC document. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION suggested requesting the Secretariat to compile only a three-page report. The draft decision was adopted, despite the objection of the Russian Federation.
302	1998	enb1289e	['Canada', 'United States']	Regarding the contact group convened to consider FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects) and the related articles of the Kyoto Protocol (2.3 and 3.14), SAUDI ARABIA stressed the need for an unambiguous text that could be adopted by the COP. MAURITANIA called on the Secretariat to provide more detailed information regarding the Parties that provide and receive funds. BOLIVIA suggested a mandate be given to the Secretariat to investigate current practice under Articles 4.8 and 4.9. The US and CANADA indicated that the issues raised by Articles 4.8 and 4.9 and the subsequent decisions should be separate. With AUSTRALIA, they said the issue should be considered in a non- political manner. The EU acknowledged the concerns of developing countries and suggested prioritizing the development of effective mitigation measures and the compilation of technical information.
156	1998	enb1296e	['United States', 'Kazakhstan']	The US, THAILAND, PERU and TUVALU announced their signature of the Kyoto Protocol. TRINIDAD and TOBAGO, on behalf of CARICOM and HAITI, said BAHAMAS will sign the Protocol this week. MICRONESIA, ITALY, CHILE, LITHUANIA, CYPRUS and the SOLOMON ISLANDS stated that they were in the process of ratifying the Protocol. JAPAN and SLOVENIA called for the early signing and ratification of the Protocol. KAZAKHSTAN expressed willingness to undertake obligations and enter into Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol through Annex I of the FCCC.
465	1998	enb1294e	['United States']	Co-Chair John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) presented the draft decision on the financial mechanism. He noted that there were no brackets in the text, but one group had indicated its dissent. The EU bracketed paragraphs on GEF funding for implementing adaptation responses and meeting full agreed costs. The US bracketed language on international centers. The G-77/CHINA bracketed the entire text. The text was accepted with brackets. SBI then adopted the draft report of its ninth session (FCCC/SBSTA/1998/L.8)
457	1998	enb1293e	['Canada', 'United States']	The contact group on mechanisms met to debate a draft work programme on mechanisms. The G-77/CHINA submitted a proposed work programme containing an extensive list of issues, embodying a step-by-step approach and prioritizing the CDM. In response, the US, supported by CANADA and AUSTRALIA, suggested the contact group address four questions: what type of decision should be made, when, by whom, and how it should move forward. He added that there were two options, negotiate the items or keep the list of items open. The EU said the G-77/China draft programme lacked inter alia, a clear timeline, deadlines and allocation of work to different bodies. They rejected the prioritization of work, calling for parallel development of all three mechanisms. The Co-Chairs introduced a draft decision on mechanisms, taking into consideration the views expressed at the Group, admitting that it was outside their mandate. Australia said the issues settled at Kyoto should not be re-opened. As of 10:30 p.m. the delegates were unable to reach agreement and were continuing deliberations. They will meet from 11:00am-2:00pm on Tuesday.
462	1998	enb1294e	['United States']	Delegates adopted most of the text unchanged, modifying the preamble to reflect the role of the private sector in some countries. A paragraph requesting SBSTA to establish a consultative process to consider the issues listed in the Annex engendered debate. The G-77/CHINA favored retaining reference to a technology transfer mechanism and considering the paragraph along with a bracketed reference in the Annex, which required consideration of appropriate mechanisms for technology transfer with the UNFCCC. The PHILIPPINES suggested a body was needed to operationalize the process, adding that experts involved in the consultative process should be from the FCCC roster of experts. The US, with the EU, said the aim of the consultative process should be meaningful and effective action. The G-77/CHINA favored technology transfer mechanism, but indicated willingness to accept meaningful and effective action if brackets were removed from the Annex.
204	1998	enb1291e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'United States', 'Monaco']	SWITZERLAND supported the draft decision but suggested possible amendments to the timeframe and scope of work. The US proposed amending the decision to reflect the differing legal status of the Convention and the Protocol. The EU, supported by MONACO, noted the need to specify ways to facilitate cooperation and stressed coordination of IPCC and FCCC activities through a joint working group. He proposed establishing a compliance mechanism and scheduling a meeting for early 1999. JAPAN noted the need for time for consultation and difficulties in combining ongoing work under the FCCC and the Protocol. He opposed deadlines for setting compliance procedures until the mechanisms were elaborated. CANADA called for a balance between the Convention and the Protocol and said Protocol issues need attention so that Parties will ratify it.
207	1998	enb1291e	['Canada', 'United States']	The contact group on the implementation of Article 4(8) and (9) (adverse effects on developing countries), chaired by Bo Kjellen (Sweden) and Mohammad Reza Salamat (Iran) met to discuss a non-paper prepared by the Chairs. The G-77/CHINA suggested requesting the Annex I Parties to include information on possible impacts in their national communications. Discussion revolved around inter alia: the need for information on the adverse effects of climate change and the impacts of response measures; the nature of information needed; the party responsible for providing the information; and the right forum to present the information. SAUDI ARABIA, LIBYA and other developing countries stressed that information be provided by Parties that had capacity and resources. The US, with JAPAN, CANADA and others, objected to the proposal, as it was impractical if not impossible to assess impacts outside their borders. The Chairs took the views of Parties under advisement.
206	1998	enb1291e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	With SWITZERLAND, the EU recognized that there is a link between the Montreal and Kyoto Protocols. He requested the subsidiary bodies to provide a list of available technologies to limit and reduce emissions of HFCs and PFCs. The US, with AUSTRALIA, said there should be coordination between international environmental agreements, but the process required careful consideration given the possible implication on industry. He proposed that SBSTA consider the impact of the phase out of substances covered under the Montreal Protocol and asked that they consult with that body. Chairman Chow proposed that he hold consultations on this matter.
122	1998	enb1292e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	The joint contact group on mechanisms, chaired by Luiz Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil) and Yvo de Boer (Netherlands) met on Friday to discuss a work programme prepared by the Co-Chairs. The G- 77/CHINA stressed the need for a clear section devoted to the nature and scope of the mechanisms to facilitate comparison. He added that the mechanisms should not exacerbate the economic disadvantage of certain countries, and called for the CDM to be discussed on a priority basis. HONDURAS, supported by several Latin American countries, suggested expeditious creation of the CDM, calling for an interim phase approach to develop guidelines and rules. The US stressed parallel progress on all mechanisms. The EU preferred a general, rather than a detailed, debate. NEW ZEALAND stressed the importance of developing a timeline for discussion. Several Parties expressed concern about the length of the draft work programme. SWITZERLAND provided the Chairs with a two-page work programme. The contact group met on Saturday to continue discussion on the work programme, with a much-shortened version prepared by the Co-Chairs that included the Honduran interim phase proposal. After some discussion, the Chair acknowledged differences in views among the Parties, but said they were not incompatible. He suggested the Parties conduct informal discussions and reconvene on Monday.
205	1998	enb1291e	['United States']	The Chair said Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14 were within the scope of the contact groups work and the group would determine its own agenda. KUWAIT, NIGERIA and SAUDI ARABIA sought a clear mandate for the contact group to consider Articles 2.3 and 3.14. The US, JAPAN and AUSTRALIA said decision 3/CP.3, which specified the mandate of the contact group, did not require specific consideration of Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14. The EU said the issue merited discussion but it was unnecessary to highlight specific articles.
121	1998	enb1292e	['United States']	The contact group on the financial mechanism, chaired by John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) and Dan Reifsnyder (US), met to discuss additional guidance to and status of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). The group first discussed a draft decision presented by the G-77/CHINA (FCCC/CP/1998/MISC.3/Add.1). While the EU supported the overall framework of the G-77/China draft decision, with the US, he said it should not include funding for stage II and III processes. AUSTRALIA indicated that he might support stage II efforts now and stage III.
123	1998	enb1292e	['United States']	The contact group on technology met on Friday and Saturday to discuss the proposals for a draft decision put forward by the US, EU and G-77/China. The G-77/CHINA presented the principles of the proposed technology transfer mechanism, drawing upon the US and EU proposals. Further functions or features would be determined as the process develops. The US reiterated its view on market based technology transfer, noting that the Kyoto Protocol places technology transfer and the market at the core of the deliberations. Co-Chair Christ suggested the cat, as the process was referred to, could represent consultation and capacity, access and advice on barrier removals and technology transfer. She cautioned against duplication of ongoing activities, such as the preparation of the IPCC Special Report on Methodological and Technical Issues in Technology Transfer. The PHILIPPINES questioned the need for further material compilations and said although market based transfer exists, it was not effective and required further measures. The Co-Chair proposed that the Secretariat integrate the three proposals. The delegates discussed the new draft at length and made significant progress. On Saturday evening, the meeting adjourned to allow further consultations on the outstanding issues relating to what to call the process.
209	1998	enb1291e	['United States']	The US opposed the reference to non-commercial, preferential terms citing its rejection when the Convention was being negotiated in favor of the market which was understood as the best way to proceed. SIERRA LEONE said the failure of the market approach to technology transfer was the reason to deliberate on how to proceed. The EU supported AUSTRALIA in proposing a clearinghouse mechanism similar to the one under the Convention on Biodiversity. He opposed the creation of a new financial mechanism. The delegates debated, inter alia: the necessity, possible form and functions of the TTM; issues relating to the transfer of public domain technology; the features of a consultative process; and the role of dialogue between Parties.
466	1998	enb1294e	['Norway', 'Iceland', 'Switzerland', 'United States', 'Russia', 'Canada']	The contact group on flexibility mechanisms considered the initial work programme on Protocol mechanisms. In addition to the G-77/China proposal submitted earlier, draft work programmes were submitted by AUSTRALIA (on behalf of CANADA, ICELAND, NEW ZEALAND, NORWAY, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and the US), JAPAN, SWITZERLAND and the Co-Chairs. After extensive deliberations, Co-Chair Yvo de Boer (Netherlands) suggested textual amendments. The title of the work programme would include a footnote stating the existence of elements in this list is without prejudice to inclusion of these items in the rules, modalities and guidelines developed for these mechanisms. The discussion on principles would be limited to the application of existing principles, and the references to FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects) would be deleted.
208	1998	enb1291e	['United States']	The Contact group on technology discussed technology transfer issues and a draft decision for the COP. Three draft decisions proposed by the US, G-77/China and the EU (FCCC/CP/1998/MISC.5/Add.3) were circulated. The US said communications between Parties were hindered by the differing conceptual understandings of the issues. He said that technology transfer should be based on country specific needs and proposed that reference be made to successful programmes. He supported the Secretariat's proposal for a consultative process that would facilitate dialogue between Parties. The G-77/China proposal focused on identifying means of linking the issues and providing an interface between the providers of technology and the recipients. It proposed a technology transfer mechanism (TTM) to assist developing country Parties to obtain their needed environmentally sound technologies and know-how conducive to addressing climate change on non-commercial and preferential terms and thus contribute to the ultimate objective of the convention. There was consensus on the capacity building section of the G-77/China proposal, which called for efforts to enhance endogenous capacities and provide enabling environments.
162	1998	enb1296e	['Canada']	SEYCHELLES expressed concern that vulnerable nations that are insignificant on the global stage may be excluded from programmes such as those under the flexibility mechanisms. THAILAND supported north-south and south-south partnerships based on equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. SPAIN called for progress on developing a process of technology transfer and efforts to address the issue of public awareness and education. FRANCE called for a common approach to collective measures and said mechanisms should be based on a reliable system of compliance that includes sanctions. CROATIA said the flexibility mechanisms must be equitable, i.e. open, transparent, verifiable and non- discriminatory. EGYPT emphasized the equal treatment of the three flexibility mechanisms and suggested that part of the proceeds from these mechanisms be mobilized to finance the transfer of adaptation technology for developing countries. BRAZIL underscored the CDM as a means of inducing new and mostly private investment, and suggested that it be project based and include all countries. CANADA described the CDM as a win-win- win mechanism, i.e. win for the environment, win for sustainable development and win for the developed countries, as they would be able to meet the Kyoto Protocol targets. VENEZUELA said CDM projects must ensure net contribution to sustainable development in the host country; avoid hidden costs; and use project-based rather than sectoral or national baselines to avoid future imposition of targets.
124	1998	enb1292e	['Canada', 'United States']	The contact group on FCCC Article 4.2 (a) and (b) (review of adequacy of commitments), co-chaired by Jennifer Irish (Canada) and Margaret Mukahanana (Zimbabwe), met over the weekend. A discussion of four draft proposals, presented by AUSTRALIA, the EU, G-77/CHINA and the US, dominated discussion. Debate concerned procedural issues on how to address the texts, with the G-77/CHINA indicating its reluctance to consider a compilation text prepared by the Co-Chairs. After extensive debate, the G-77/CHINA proposed, with the EU and NEW ZEALAND, a reworked text as a negotiating document. The US, with the eventual support of G-77/CHINA, rejected the compilation document and called on the four draft decisions to be presented in their entirety to the SBI. The Parties justified the cautious approach, citing this issues crucial importance to national positions. CHINA said he interpreted the US and AUSTRALIA proposals as an attempt to exact commitments from developing countries. The US and AUSTRALIA noted that the scientific and technical evaluation from the IPCC indicated that developed country actions would be insufficient to meet the aims of the Convention, and the US incorporated this into its submission. The meeting ended without clear resolution about the report the Co-Chairs should present to the SBI.
318	1998	enb1290e	['Canada', 'United States']	CANADA said the adaptation fee should be minimal and predictable. The US underscored the importance of meeting targets at the lowest cost to sustain public support. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA said the private sector could only embark on long-term planning once details for operationalizing the CDM are elaborated. Yvo De Boer (Netherlands) and Luis Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil) will co-chair a joint contact group on mechanisms.
464	1998	enb1294e	['United States']	In describing the results of the contact group on FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects), Co-Chair Bo Kjellen (Sweden) said the text reflects the objectives and there is general agreement on outstanding issues. The two bracketed paragraphs in the preamble reflected the lack of time for full negotiation. The G-77/CHINA said there were compromises even in the unbracketed text. He said the group would accept the document, including the brackets, to preserve momentum. The US, with the EU, said the impression of general agreement was misleading. He said the contact group never discussed this text and there was no agreement on the work plan. SAUDI ARABIA stated there was no consensus and suggested that if the whole text is bracketed, then all texts should be bracketed.
163	1998	enb1296e	['Ukraine']	GREECE supported agreement on clear principles, modalities, rules and guidelines for the flexibility mechanisms including ceilings on their use. SOUTH AFRICA supported development of a clear programme of work, establishment of an intersessional working group and a timeframe to ensure the Kyoto targets are met. UKRAINE stressed establishment of a work programme for implementation of Kyoto obligations by Annex I Parties. He said revival in transition economies will lead to inevitable increases in GHG emissions, but these countries will achieve internal reductions. He opposed the revision of decisions taken at Kyoto.
458	1998	enb1293e	['United States']	Some participants reported that the US and the EU held high level negotiations on Saturday concerning the development of compliance mechanism(s). The EU reportedly supports a comprehensive regime and a work plan to establish it, but expressed concern that the US policy is unclear. No agreement was reached and some have reported that meaningful progress seems unlikely. Some G-77/CHINA delegates expressed increasing discomfort with the continuing focus on voluntary commitments presented in the BuenosAyres newspaper. Sentiment peaked when the paper published a survey suggesting that 66 countries of 130 surveyed desired debate on this topic.
164	1998	enb1296e	['United States']	Several Parties including DENMARK, VENEZUELA, POLAND, AUSTRALIA, FRANCE, the EU and the US called for the establishment of a coherent, effective and strong compliance system. The G-77/CHINA called for a decision on compliance at COP-4. GERMANY suggested a ceiling for mechanisms and, with FRANCE, supported the inclusion of sanctions in the compliance system.
468	1998	enb1294e	['Canada', 'United States']	On Protocol Articles 6, 12 and 17, Co-Chairs Luiz Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil) and Yvo de Boer (the Netherlands) reported that the joint contact group did not agree on a draft work programme. The EU and AUSTRALIA and others put forward the documents they had produced for the contact group. Co-Chairs Kante and Chow distributed a draft decision on the work progamme on mechanisms. The G-77/CHINA urged discussion of the contact group Co-Chairs draft, with CHINA opposing the use of other documents. SOUTH AFRICA and UGANDA rejected the G-77/CHINA position, saying they were unaware the group had discussed the new proposal. With the US, EU, CANADA, JAPAN, KUWAIT and AUSTRALIA, the AFRICAN GROUP favored bracketing the new Co- Chairs draft entirely. VENEZUELA said forwarding the Co-Chairs text would require formulation of a joint Subsidiary Bodies position. KUWAIT suggested the draft decision of the SBSTA/SBI Co-Chairs be forwarded to the COP as a Chairs text. Co-Chair Kante suggested forwarding both texts to the Plenary: the draft work plan proposed by the contact group Co-Chairs and the draft decision proposed by the SBSTA/SBI Co-Chairs. Delegates agreed but it remained uncertain which of the texts would be bracketed.
463	1998	enb1294e	['United States']	The Chair closed the formal meeting and began informal discussions. The EU said the Annex was not a negotiated text and supported the US proposal to leave the debate to the high-level segment, as it related to other issues under negotiation. The Chair proposed compromise wording. After some debate, the Chair invited the EU, the US and the G-77/China to discuss the issue informally.
497	1999	enb12113e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	On Annex I communications, the US recommended that only Part I (general description of guidelines) be negotiated through a contact group and adopted during COP-5. SWITZERLAND, with the EU and AUSTRALIA, supported adopting the guidelines at COP-5. AUSTRALIA said the guidelines may be applicable to Protocol inventories.
149	1999	enb12114e	['Russia', 'Canada', 'Switzerland', 'Norway']	The G77/CHINA referred to its draft decision that, inter alia, requests the Secretariat to prepare a plan to facilitate capacity building for developing countries. He underscored the importance of workshops being undertaken with the participation of developing countries. The CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC highlighted the futility of short workshops, as developing countries needed continuous ones. The EU suggested: identifying non-Annex I Parties’ needs by analyzing their national communications; identifying existing capacities; agreeing on a process to ensure that priority areas receive appropriate support; and providing guidance for establishing an assessment of capacity-building activities on climate change. CANADA supported a coordinated response among existing efforts in capacity building and proposed three steps: assessment of needs; overview of actions currently undertaken by various actors; and definition of a clear scope for action. AUSTRALIA sought information from the Secretariat on current support for developing countries in order to identify gaps and needs for future work. NORWAY favored an integrated approach for the identification of needs. SWITZERLAND endorsed a practical approach focused on identifying appropriate needs in specific areas. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION offered technology transfer assistance.
538	1999	enb12117e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	Delegates then addressed the structure of a compliance body. On the nature of a compliance body, a number of delegates said it should be a standing body in order to allow consistency and continuity in its practice, as well as build confidence in its work. On the frequency of the compliance body’s meetings, AOSIS and SOUTH AFRICA said it would depend on the amount of work it had before it and that meetings should be held together with other meetings under the FCCC. The EU said meetings should be held regularly, and SWITZERLAND suggested it meet at least once a year, given the continuous work of the compliance body. On the body’s size and composition, a number of delegates suggested a small body composed of scientific, technical and legal experts appointed by governments yet acting in their personal capacity. They said the composition of the body should ensure equitable geographic distribution. POLAND said there should be an equal number of Protocol Annex B and non-Annex B Parties, and AUSTRALIA, supported by the US, added that the composition would depend upon the article under review. SWITZERLAND, with SOUTH AFRICA, said it should be possible to call on outside experts. He added that additional Annex I Parties’ experts should be called on when considering Protocol Article 3. A number of delegates, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, stressed the need for the body to have its own rules of procedure. The EU said these rules should be adopted by the body itself, while KUWAIT, BRAZIL and CHINA said the COP/MOP should adopt these rules.
647	1999	enb12116e	['Russia', 'Switzerland']	SWITZERLAND emphasized the need to standardize testing procedures for technologies in developing countries. GREENPEACE called for action to avoid dumping of potentially harmful technologies in developing countries. ARGENTINA, supported by KENYA, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and POLAND, called for attention to the medical use of HFCs in metered dose inhalers. Discussions will continue in informal consultations.
649	1999	enb12116e	['United States']	The JWG on compliance heard four diagrammatic submissions illustrating a compliance system. The US said that its design for the compliance system is focused on Protocol Article 3 (GHG reduction and limitation commitments) and provides for both facilitative and enforcement functions to be dealt with ''by two different sets of people.'' She said the goal of enforcement is to ensure compliance through binding consequences that are known in advance. In presenting its preliminary views, JAPAN proposed a single compliance body and outlined steps ranging from assistance to recommendations to be exhausted before the entry into force of consequences. The EU explained that its compliance committee would have a facilitative branch and an enforcement branch, with a possible referral from the former to the latter. Issues would be channeled automatically to the branches. SAMOA stressed two features of the AOSIS diagram: avoidance of polarization between the facilitative and enforcement functions, since they overlap, and an eligibility committee responsible for the determination of mechanism eligibility. He added that an ad hoc appeal body would hear quasi-judicial appeals on the imposition of binding penalties.
472	1999	enb12120e	['Kazakhstan', 'United States']	Participation/voluntary commitments: Many Parties noted the need for global participation. AOSIS and others stated that, at the appropriate time, it will be necessary for all countries to participate formally in the effort to reduce GHG emissions. ARGENTINA announced that it had adopted a voluntary target to reduce its GHG emissions, noting that it does not intend to abandon its status as a non-Annex I Party. She said their target would be to achieve a 2 to 10% reduction below “business-as-usual” in the 2008 - 2012 period. KAZAKHSTAN said it intended to join FCCC Annex I. JAPAN, the US, AUSTRALIA and others welcomed the initiatives by Kazakhstan and Argentina. The EU said a possible way of making all countries limit their GHG emissions is to agree on increasing global participation after the first commitment period. CHINA and INDIA said Annex I countries have the main responsibility. CHINA said it would not undertake commitments until it achieves a “medium development level.”
650	1999	enb12116e	['Canada', 'United States', 'United Kingdom']	On eligibility to raise issues, the UK explained that the mere provision of information would not “trigger” the compliance procedure, but that it would be triggered by whatever causes the compliance procedure to start considering a claim. Many delegates agreed that a Party could raise an issue about its own compliance, and that a Party or group of Parties could raise an issue about another Party’s compliance. CANADA said sufficient evidence should be provided to support cases. IRAN said only a group of Parties could trigger a case of another Party’s compliance. The EU, CANADA, CHINA, JAPAN, IRAN, SOUTH AFRICA and the US opposed a triggering role for the Secretariat. Delegates emphasized its information gathering function and the need for it to preserve objectivity and neutrality.
173	1999	enb12115e	['Canada', 'Iceland']	On the impact of single projects on emissions in the commitment period, ICELAND said single projects have a greater proportional impact on emissions in smaller countries, affecting their ability to meet emissions targets. He called for a conclusive decision on this issue at COP-6. CANADA expressed reservations on the issue and opposed the draft decision tabled by Iceland at COP-4 in its current form. Informal consultations will be conducted by Ole Plougmann (Denmark) to forward conclusions or a draft decision to SBSTA.
473	1999	enb12120e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	Delegates expressed views on the project cycle of emissions trading. AOSIS sought the establishment of a common set of prin-ciples across all the mechanisms, including the principles of envi-ronmental integrity and additionality. The US said the integrity of the emissions trading system would be founded on monitoring and reporting under Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues) and 7 (communication of information) and the existence of registries. The G-77/CHINA said the nature and scope of emissions trading must be determined before operational details are worked out. He added that the postulate “you cannot sell what you do not own”should circumscribe the nature and scope of emissions trading. The US and others noted the need to develop cost-effective mecha-nisms. The EU stressed the need for the mechanisms to be under-written by strong monitoring and reporting requirements. SWITZERLAND suggested a “post-verification model” wherein emission reduction units could not be transferred until they have been certified to be excess Assigned Amount Units. Parties also expressed views on, inter alia: the notions of “fungibility,” liability and book keeping.
539	1999	enb12117e	['Canada', 'United States']	MECHANISMS: This contact group deliberated on a possible workplan up to COP-6. The EU and the US sought intensification of the process, in particular through technical workshops. CHINA, INDONESIA and IRAN highlighted the need to convene intersessional meetings to strengthen intergovernmental work. JAPAN and CANADA said both technical workshops and intersessional meetings should be held prior to COP-6. CANADA added that it would like to see a refined negotiating text at COP-6. The G-77/CHINA and others highlighted the need for transparency in the process and adequate developing country expert participation in the technical workshops. SUDAN said Parties needed time to review the information and findings of technical workshops.
16	1999	enb12119e	['Canada', 'United States', 'Norway']	MECHANISMS: On CDM project monitoring, MAURITANIA said monitoring and reporting should not burden the host country. BOLIVIA suggested that Parties monitor their own projects and ďż˝learn by doing.ďż˝ NORWAY and AUSTRALIA said that project participants, the host Party or a designated legal entity should monitor. The EU said operational entities should perform certification and verification, which is dependent on monitoring. Parties also discussed conflicts of interest, random audits of projects, project oversight by NGOs, and share of proceeds. On Article 6 project validation, JAPAN cautioned against creating unnecessary bureaucracies. NEW ZEALAND noted that the host Party would have to cancel some of its assigned amount. CANADA and the US noted that Protocol Article 8 (review of information) provides a built-in review. The EU questioned how additionality could be ensured if Parties did not comply with Protocol Articles 5 and 7.
15	1999	enb12119e	['United States']	On a paragraph in the draft conclusions outlining progress at SB-10 and SB-11, AUSTRALIA and the US suggested replacing “procedures and mechanisms” relating to a compliance system with “procedures and processes,” in order to include consideration of Protocol Articles 8 (expert review teams) and 16 (dispute settlement). SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by SAMOA, the EU, the US and NEW ZEALAND, proposed moving towards “implementation of decision 8/CP4” (procedures and mechanisms on compliance) rather than towards “negotiations.”
153	1999	enb12114e	['Switzerland', 'United States', 'Uzbekistan', 'Russia', 'Norway']	The G-77/CHINA said a CDM decision must precede decisions on other mechanisms. AUSTRALIA noted the need for considerable technical work prior to COP-6. The EU noted significant areas of convergence among Parties but said a ceiling on the use of mechanisms has to be defined. The US supported parallel progress on the mechanisms with priority given to the CDM. With NORWAY and SWITZERLAND, he suggested refining the synthesis into a draft negotiating text. NORWAY further identified the need to decide on a work plan in the run-up to COP-6. AOSIS highlighted the need for the mechanisms to be based on sound environmental principles and, with VENEZUELA, called for adequate time for consideration. He added that AOSIS would not permit mechanisms that allow Annex I Parties to offload domestic responsibilities. UZBEKISTAN, with the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, sought clear definitions of core concepts. CHINA opposed taking a single decision on all mechanisms as this was not supported by the Protocol. He recommended that there be three distinct decisions on the mechanisms. SAUDI ARABIA stressed that progress on this issue is conditional on progress on other equally important issues. A contact group, to be chaired by Kok Kee Chow, was asked to revise and consolidate the views into a draft negotiating text and agree on a work plan in the run-up to COP-6. The G-77/CHINA said that the reference to the draft negotiating text was unwarranted at this stage.
14	1999	enb12119e	['United States']	ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS: On arrangements for intergovernmental meetings, delegates adopted the draft conclusion on improving the intergovernmental process. On the date and venue of COP-6 and the calendar of meetings of Convention bodies (FCCC/SBI/1999/CRP.14), SAUDI ARABIA objected to having two intersessional meetings instead of one, noting the difficulties with financing developing countries’ participation. He proposed delaying the decision until the financial issues had been addressed. AUSTRALIA, the US and the EU supported the calendar of events. SBI noted the objection by SAUDI ARABIA and adopted the draft conclusions and annexed draft decision.
151	1999	enb12114e	['Switzerland']	Opposed by AOSIS, BOTSWANA and IRAN, the EU, with SWITZERLAND, proposed that AIJ should be credited retroactively. She identified the lack of crediting and capacity in the host countries and high transaction costs for small projects as barriers in the pilot phase. SWITZERLAND and AUSTRALIA said that without credit, industries would be cautious about AIJ.
150	1999	enb12114e	['United States']	ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED JOINTLY: On the experience with AIJ, the G-77/CHINA underlined the imbalance of the geographical distribution of pilot projects and urged extension of the pilot phase. AOSIS said carbon sequestration projects may not guarantee measurable and long-term effects and expressed concern over the possible inclusion of sinks. With the MARSHALL ISLANDS, BOTSWANA and SAMOA, he opposed linking AIJ to the Protocol mechanisms. JAPAN, supported by the EU, said the experience gained is sufficient for a comprehensive review. With POLAND, he stressed that an AIJ project should be eligible under joint implementation (JI) or CDM if it meets the criteria for eligibility and if the Parties involved agree. The MARSHALL ISLANDS urged discontinuation of temporary carbon storage projects under AIJ. The US proposed exploring the eligibility of AIJ projects under CDM or JI.
498	1999	enb12113e	['Uzbekistan']	SBI discussed the first synthesis report of non-Annex I initial communications. On obstacles to producing non-Annex I communications, the G-77/CHINA called for provision of adequate financial resources, technical assistance and capacity-building to support non-Annex I countries in collecting data and identifying national emission factors and methodologies for adaptation assessment. The EU, opposed by CHINA, said the GEF had provided most non-Annex I Parties with funding for national communications. UZBEKISTAN noted that constraints included lack of research and data on emissions factors. IRAN noted that countries also have needs determined by their unique circumstances.
148	1999	enb12114e	['Kazakhstan']	On recipients of capacity building, the G77/CHINA said these are developing countries only, while the EU, KAZAKHSTAN and others said it included countries with economies in transition.
496	1999	enb12113e	['Norway', 'Ukraine']	The COP elected its Bureau members. The Vice-Presidents elected were: Papa Cham (The Gambia), Phillip Gwage (Uganda), Mohamed Al-Sabban (Saudi Arabia), Liu Zhenmin (China), Olexander Bielov (Ukraine), Yvo De Boer (Netherlands), Neroni Slade (Samoa). The COP elected Antonio Vallini Guerreiro (Brazil) as Rapporteur, John Ashe (Antigua & Barbuda) as Chair of SBI and Harald Dovland (Norway) as Chair of SBSTA. Delegates then adopted the proposed organization of work for COP-5.
648	1999	enb12116e	['Canada', 'United States']	ROSTER OF EXPERTS: The US said expansion of rosters should only be done in response to additional tasks. NEW ZEALAND supported the Secretariat’s proposal to integrate the different rosters. While the EU objected, CANADA supported additional rosters for inventory reviews.
152	1999	enb12114e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	On the reporting format, SWITZERLAND stressed simplicity. The US suggested that the Secretariat convene a technical meeting on the common reporting format. A contact group will be convened chaired by Yvo de Boer (Netherlands).
499	1999	enb12113e	['Canada']	On the advantages of producing non-Annex I communications, the G-77/CHINA said that despite difficulties in identifying significant trends, the synthesis of initial non-Annex I communications was a first step in considering information related to FCCC implementation by non-Annex I Parties. The EU, CANADA and MICRONESIA noted the usefulness of the compilation and synthesis report in better understanding the difficulties faced by non-Annex I Parties.
651	1999	enb12116e	['Canada', 'United States']	Regarding the Expert Review Teams (ERTs), the EU said the ERTs’ reports would be automatically submitted to the compliance committee through the Secretariat. CANADA said the reports were the factual basis that determined the need for further steps. CHINA, with IRAN, KUWAIT, BRAZIL and ARGENTINA said it was inappropriate to give ERTs, a simple fact finding body, a triggering role. SOUTH AFRICA explained that doing so could endanger the objectivity of the ERTs. The US and AUSTRALIA suggested guidelines for a possible referral to the compliance body.
501	1999	enb12113e	['United States', 'United Kingdom']	On Annex I communications, the EU noted the need to include indicators such as emissions per capita or emissions per unit of output. Regarding the draft guidance for reporting on Global Climate Observation Systems (GCOS), the EU, with MONGOLIA, recommended that Annex I Parties prepare separate reports on global climate observation and include in their national communications a summary based on general reporting requirements. AUSTRALIA suggested that projections of the effect of policies and measures on future trends of GHG emissions and removals be developed by sector. The MARSHALL ISLANDS and JAMAICA supported detailed and rigorous reporting. The US said the quantity and level of detail should balance needs for comparability, transparency and practicality. A contact group chaired by Jim Penman (UK) and Mark Mwandosya (Tanzania) will meet to consider this issue.
169	1999	enb12115e	['United States']	ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS: On income and budget performance in the biennium 1998-1999 and arrangements for administrative support to the FCCC, the EU proposed an open-ended group to clarify some issues. The G-77/CHINA called for informal consultations by Chair Ashe. The US expressed hope for the resolution of pending issues on non-Annex I communications to ensure budgetary resources on this topic.
170	1999	enb12115e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	Several Parties said the private sector should drive technology transfer. AUSTRALIA, the US and the EU highlighted the potential role of the clean development mechanism (CDM) in technology transfer. The PHILIPPINES, with SAUDI ARABIA and CHINA, stressed that technology transfer was a commitment under the FCCC and opposed linking it to the CDM. CHINA said technology transfer under the Protocol should be additional to that under the FCCC. The PHILIPPINES called for information on technology transfer activities in Annex-I communications. AOSIS stressed addressing adaptation technologies. The G-77/CHINA called for a COP-5 decision on capacity building. SWITZERLAND underscored consideration of specific national circumstances. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA noted the need to review the transfer of public-funded technology in the consultative process. The CLIMATE TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE provided an overview of its ventures as a multilateral facilitator of technology diffusion. A draft decision will be prepared.
246	1999	enb12121e	['United States']	AUSTRALIA proposed the establishment of a Committee of the Whole (COW) chaired by a facilitator vested with the requisite authority by the COP-5 President. The US said it could support this, but that a COW should not substitute for Japan’s proposal for a facilitator. BELGIUM supported a flexible approach focused on achieving successful outcomes and said a COW or another new structure should be transparent and monitored by all Parties.
168	1999	enb12115e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'United States']	ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS: On the date and venue of COP-6, the G-77/CHINA proposed holding it in November 2000 and expressed concern over the proliferation of intersessional activities and workshops, their budgetary implications and obstacles for developing country participation. In view of the workload to meet the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA), the US, with CANADA, AUSTRALIA and NEW ZEALAND, said COP-6 should be held early in 2001 with various intersessional activities on the run-up. CHINA said the BAPA only calls for “demonstrable progress” by COP-6. The EU and others emphasized the need for sufficient progress to allow early entry into force of the Protocol. To maintain political momentum, JAPAN noted its preference for COP-6 in November 2000. SWITZERLAND said timing of COP-6 should result from progress on pending issues and highlighted the need for a work-plan.
167	1999	enb12115e	['United States']	ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS: On GHG inventory data for Annex I communications, the US, with POLAND, stressed that timeliness and completeness of submissions were critical in providing a basis for COP action. The EU noted that its future national systems would fulfill quality and time requirements, and expressed concern about the continuous increase in GHG emissions since 1997.
471	1999	enb12120e	['United States']	Mechanisms: Many Parties said the use of mechanisms should be supplementary to domestic action. The EU highlighted its proposal setting a ceiling on the use of the mechanisms, and urged the development of a revised negotiating text by COP-6. Several Parties supported the prompt adoption of principles and modalities, rules and guidelines for the mechanisms. The G-77/CHINA said differences in the nature, scope, purpose of and participation in the three mechanisms should be decided before making decisions on modalities, operational and methodological issues and institutional arrangements. The US called for the mechanisms to be designed cost effectively and developing countries to participate meaningfully.
504	1999	enb12113e	['Canada']	Regarding adjustments, AUSTRALIA said they are intended as an element of the Protocolï¿½s compliance system. The EU and JAPAN stated that further discussion on technical aspects should only occur after the completion of IPCCï¿½s work on good practice. CANADA noted the lack of clarity in what an adjustment would be. With NEW ZEALAND, he expressed support for a technical review process of inventories, noting that this is fundamental to the development of an adjustment process. Helen Plume (New Zealand) will conduct informal consultations.
247	1999	enb12121e	['Norway', 'Switzerland', 'United States', 'United Kingdom', 'Canada']	Co-Chair Rønneberg (Marshall Islands) presented the draft report of the JWG on its work during the 11th session of the joint SBI/SBSTA as well as the decision on the future work of the JWG annexed to this report. The JWG discussed the draft decision which requests the JWG to report to COP-6 to enable it to adopt a decision on a compliance system under the Protocol at COP-6. The UK, CHILE, MICRONESIA, COOK ISLANDS, SWITZERLAND, the US, TUVALU, AOSIS, CANADA, JAPAN, AUSTRIA, KIRIBATI, the EU, NEW ZEALAND, FRANCE, the GAMBIA, BRAZIL, SOUTH AFRICA, AUSTRALIA, SLOVENIA, NORWAY, POLAND, BELGIUM and GERMANY supported the adoption of the Co-Chairs’ draft decision in its current form. QATAR, KUWAIT, the SUDAN, VENEZUELA, SAUDI ARABIA, LIBYA, ALGERIA, NIGERIA, SYRIA, OMAN and JORDAN suggested alternative language whereby the JWG would report to COP-6 “with a view” to adopting a decision on a compliance system, as this would be more consistent with the BAPA. The JWG adopted the draft report, taking note of the views expressed. Rønneberg suggested that the difference in ambition be taken-up in the joint SBSTA/SBI meeting.
455	1999	enb12118e	['United States']	The operative paragraphs of the draft decision on the future work of the JWG on compliance requires the JWG to “continue its work” beyond COP-5 and “complete its work” before COP-6. NEW ZEALAND, with AUSTRALIA, ARGENTINA, the US, the EU, BAHAMAS, CHILE and the FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA, sought to retain the phrase “complete its work,” as Parties had a responsibility to achieve the objectives of the BAPA and it would be difficult to justify a less ambitious goal. CHINA, NIGERIA and SAUDI ARABIA sought alternative language supporting substantial progress by COP-6. A revised Co-Chairs’ draft conclusions and decision based on Parties’ suggestions will be available on Monday.
245	1999	enb12121e	['Canada', 'United States', 'Kazakhstan', 'Iceland']	JAPAN, supported by KAZAKHSTAN, BOTSWANA, the US, CANADA, BENIN, ICELAND, HONDURAS and SOUTH AFRICA, suggested that COP-5 President Szyszko (Poland) be empowered to appoint a special facilitator to assist negotiations and help Parties realize the BAPA by COP-6.
652	1999	enb12116e	['Norway', 'United States']	MECHANISMS: Chair Chow (Malaysia) took the participants through the Synthesis of Parties’ Proposals on Mechanisms (FCCC/SB/1999/8). He highlighted certain sections, noted areas of convergence and divergence, and suggested issues for consideration. The EU, NORWAY and the US suggested ways of consolidating and tightening the text. On the CDM, the G-77/CHINA pointed to deficiencies in the text, including the absence of a section on ï¿½nature and scopeï¿½ and the lack of a determination of what the driving force of the CDM should be. On a general note, SAUDI ARABIA reiterated its reservation on aiming for a draft negotiating text by SB-12, as this was premature. The G-77/CHINA said technical appendices complicate the issue and stressed the need to address the technical issues. He also noted the need for Parties to meet in their regional groups.
242	1999	enb12121e	['Switzerland']	INDONESIA emphasized the importance of making benefit assessments, not just cost assessments, of the Protocol. He called for the Protocol’s entry into force by 2002. SWITZERLAND, JAPAN and the NETHERLANDS urged Parties not to wait for ratification before starting to implement actions to address climate change.
470	1999	enb12120e	['United Kingdom']	Protocol ratification: Numerous Parties supported the Protocol’s entry into force by Rio+10, 2002, including, inter alia: BULGARIA, CARICOM, the EU, FRANCE, GERMANY, HAITI, IRELAND, ITALY, JAPAN, SPAIN, SWEDEN, and the UK. The EU said more ambitious emissions reduction commitments than those agreed to at Kyoto were needed.
171	1999	enb12115e	['United States']	ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS: Regarding “best practices” in policies and measures (P&Ms), Chair Dovland announced that Denmark will host a workshop in April 2000. The EU said the upcoming workshop should consider, inter alia, defining “best practices” and assessing the extent to which international cooperation may enhance effectiveness of P&Ms. AUSTRALIA preferred reference to “good” rather than “best” practices and, with JAPAN and the US, said P&Ms should reflect national circumstances. SAUDI ARABIA said the workshop should also address “wrong” practices.
248	1999	enb12121e	['Canada']	COOPERATION WITH SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATIONS: On a draft decision urging Parties and IGOs to provide financial support to the IPCC (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/CRP.9), delegates differed on the need for a reference to the GEF. The EU, with AUSTRALIA and CANADA, opposed it as the GEF would not be able to provide the support the IPCC required. CHINA said the GEF “cake” was barely enough to go around 130 developing countries. BRAZIL favored the reference as the GEF was the FCCC financial mechanism and a significant proportion of the IPCC’s finances are used to finance developing country participation. Parties adopted a decision deleting the reference to the GEF but inviting the “SBI to consider the issue of support to IPCC at SB -12 in the context of recommending additional guidance to the GEF.” Delegates adopted the draft report of SBSTA-11 (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.11).
172	1999	enb12115e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	The US highlighted the need for guidance on definitions and clarity. NEW ZEALAND, with the EU and the US, stressed improving reporting of bunker emissions for consistency and comparability. Jose Romero (Switzerland) will conduct informal consultations on this issue.
454	1999	enb12118e	['United States', 'United Kingdom']	The draft conclusions state that, inter alia: much work needs to be done and the JWG must move progressively toward negotiation; the Co-Chairs should further develop the elements of a compliance procedure, incorporating Parties’ proposals; and this paper will receive Parties’ full consideration at SB-12 and serve as a basis for negotiation. Several delegates said the draft conclusions provided a useful text to work on. SAUDI ARABIA, CHINA, the US, NIGERIA and BRAZIL said the paper developed by the Co-Chairs should be based on more sources of information. Delegates suggested that additional sources of information could be drawn from existing and further submissions by Parties, as well as discussions held during the session of the JWG and during a possible forthcoming workshop. CHINA, IRAN and SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by the EU and AUSTRALIA, suggested that the paper serve as a basis for “consideration” of compliance. NIGERIA added that nothing in the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA) required the JWG to finish its work by COP-6. The UK, opposed by the US, proposed that the paper serve as “the” basis for negotiations on compliance at the next session of the JWG.
503	1999	enb12113e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	Regarding guidelines for national systems, the EU, with JAPAN, said they should be flexible in order to reflect different national circumstances. The US highlighted the incorporation of IPCC good practice guidance. AUSTRALIA proposed including, inter alia, quality assurance and quality control procedures, links between national systems and emissions trading systems and links with the transfer and acquisition of assigned amounts. SWITZERLAND said guidelines should include criteria for national enforcement systems to comply with relevant guidelines, and the establishment and treatment of data related to Protocol mechanisms.
500	1999	enb12113e	['Switzerland']	On guidelines for non-Annex I communications, the G-77/CHINA opposed changing the guidelines, as many non-Annex I countries have not finalized their first communications. AOSIS noted the need to modify IPCC guidelines for small island developing states because they are not always applicable to their special circumstances. Since many countries had expressed an interest in initiating second national communications, the EU said guidelines should be reviewed. SWITZERLAND said there is a need for one unified reporting format for all FCCC Parties and for the use of IPCC guidelines.
502	1999	enb12113e	['United States']	Regarding additional activities, the US said there should be transparency in reporting and verifiability. According to the EU, the IPCC Special Report and country specific data should provide the basis for future discussions and decisions. A contact group will consider this issue further.
243	1999	enb12121e	['Canada', 'Switzerland']	On lessons learned, FINLAND, with CANADA, underscored good working relationships between all partners and stakeholders in implementing climate change policies. He added that there is a need to set the framework and rules for market operations. Some Parties stressed the involvement of the private sector. The EUROPEAN COMMISSION said experience has shown that reducing emissions has been less costly than expected and has led to greater benefits. With SWITZERLAND and HUNGARY, she emphasized the need for increased domestic action and called for continuation of AIJ and a smooth transition in the future to the clean development mechanism (CDM) and joint implementation (JI).
244	1999	enb12121e	['Canada']	The PHILIPPINES and CANADA recommended the use of no-regrets policies. MALAYSIA and MEXICO sought consistency in policies between different environmental fora. BULGARIA called for a meeting to address the specific features of countries with economies in transition (EITs) before COP-6.
372	2000	enb12161e	['Canada', 'United States']	"ARGENTINA expressed concern over the adoption of a compliance regime and a possible amendment of the Protocol before its entry into force. Opposed by BRAZIL, he called on Parties not to push for the most comprehensive and complex regime, but one that will be ""viable."" On consequences, he said good faith should constitute the main source of confidence in this agreement. The US said legally-binding consequences need not be punitive and highlighted that she supported a deduction from the following commitment period with a 1.3% penalty rate as well as a restriction on the transfer of units also applicable to Protocol Article 4 (joint fulfilment) Parties. The EU argued that Article 4 is not a mechanism and, commenting on ARGENTINAs intervention, said good faith it not sufficient due to inclusion of market-based mechanisms in the Protocol. He explained that legally-binding consequences were thus justified both by concerns over the environmental integrity of the Protocol, as well as by the necessity to provide the private sector with the confidence needed for the use of the mechanisms. He added that the rate of deduction should fluctuate between 1 and 1.5% and would constitute an incentive for the Party concerned to use the true-up period to take advantage of the market. CANADA said legally-binding consequences were also justified on competitiveness grounds. Pronk concluded that good faith and economics should thus guide the consequences to be adopted. The G-77/CHINA stressed that non-compliance affects everyone, and not only the trading partners of Annex I Parties. She urged that this must be reflected in the composition of the compliance committee."
371	2000	enb12161e	['Russia', 'Switzerland']	BOX D COMPLIANCE, POLICIES AND MEASURES, AND ACCOUNTING, REPORTING AND REVIEW UNDER PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8: In the morning session of the informal high-level Plenary, participants engaged in an initial exchange of views on these issues. POLAND, for the CENTRAL GROUP ELEVEN, said the treatment of non-compliance should not be based on the Parties, but on the nature of the commitment. With the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, she called for flexibility for countries with economies in transition. CHINA highlighted that a strict compliance system should be based on Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8, and that Annex I Parties reports should include information on Protocol Articles 10 (existing commitments) and 11 (financial mechanism), including in relation to additional financial resources. He added that the different responsibilities of Annex I and non-Annex I Parties should be reflected in the sections on principles, mandate and consequences. He concluded by raising the issue of the bodies composition and called for adherence to the principles of fairness and equitable geographical representation. Pronk said the question of composition was a cross-cutting issue. SWITZERLAND said the integrity of the review process requires that the competence of reviewers be a priority, and suggested training as a way to reach both this objective and ensure equitable geographical representation. Following a question by President Pronk, he said it was reasonable to have full representation in only one of the two branches of the compliance committee.
37	2000	enb12158e	['Canada', 'United States']	The G-77/CHINA highlighted the importance to the Group of Article 4.8 and 4.9, and expressed concern that the issue of financial resources is bracketed. With SAUDI ARABIA, she urged two separate decisions, one on Article 4.8 and 4.9, the other on Article 3.14. The EU, US and CANADA stated that draft conclusions are without prejudice to whether there are one or two decisions. Highlighting their vulnerability to climate change and response measures, the LDCs expressed concern with the amount of bracketed text. COLOMBIA, CHILE and VENEZUELA emphasized the vulnerability of all developing countries. Chair Ashe closed the joint SBI/SBSTA meeting at 9:55 pm.
35	2000	enb12158e	['United States']	"POLICIES AND MEASURES (P&Ms): In a brief meeting of the contact group on P&Ms, delegates agreed not to reopen negotiations on the text. The G-77/CHINA, supported by the US, EU and SAUDI ARABIA, expressed preference for the original title of the draft decision: "" Good practices in P&Ms among Parties included in Annex I to the Convention."" Delegates expressed their appreciation to the Co-Chairs, and the meeting was closed."
376	2000	enb12160e	['Norway']	LULUCF: JAMAICA strongly supported an internationally-defined biome-based approach for forests. SAMOA and MICRONESIA argued that countries should be prohibited from offsetting their obligations through activities that are neither measurable nor permanent. JAPAN said it was essential not to lose the incentives for appropriate sink activities. BOLIVIA said reduction credits resulting from natural variability should be avoided and that carbon accounting systems should be able to distinguish between human efforts and natural reductions. NORWAY said that contribution from sinks should be limited in the first commitment period. DENMARK argued that the inclusion of sinks should avoid the crediting of projects that would have happened in any case.
67	2000	enb12155e	['Canada', 'United States', 'Norway']	"On ""revegetation,"" the EU, NORWAY and PERU noted the need for a corresponding definition of ""de-vegetation."" On forest management, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND and the US called for a simple and clear definition."
36	2000	enb12158e	['United States']	The US and EU opposed a proposal by ARGENTINA in the SBI to clear text on national communications that the contact group had left bracketed. The G-77/CHINA, supported by ARGENTINA, AOSIS, SAUDI ARABIA and other developing countries, expressed disappointment at the lack of agreement on the financial mechanism.
34	2000	enb12158e	['Canada', 'United States']	The PHILIPPINES, speaking for the G-77/CHINA, rejected this procedure to consider these financial issues outside their relevant contact groups, stating that it was neither transparent nor democratic. She added that delaying tactics by the US and other developed countries for obstructing progress had become evident. The EU stressed its ongoing efforts to encourage progress and a willingness and openness to discuss further relevant issues outside this meeting. The US, with CANADA, also expressed frustration at the rate of progress, and indicated support for continuing work towards resolving the G-77/Chinas concern about the situation. The NETHERLANDS stressed the role of transparency and democracy in upholding the intergovernmental character of the process, and the importance of partnership for progress to take place. Co-Chair Ashe said he would refer the statements to President Pronk, and closed the meeting.
66	2000	enb12155e	['Norway']	"On the definition of ""forest,"" TUVALU supported the biome approach, and said it should be elaborated by COP-7. The EU, the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, NORWAY and CHILE agreed, but said the approach is not yet mature and the definition in the Co-Chairs text will suffice for the time being. They said guidance on the biome approach should be sought from the IPCC. The EU stressed the need for consistency and symmetry within all definitions, while CHINA said it would be premature to agree on definitions relevant to Protocol Article 3.4 (additional activities)."
370	2000	enb12161e	['Canada', 'United States', 'Norway']	"BOX B - MECHANISMS: During the morning informal high-level Plenary, co-facilitator Minister Kawaguchi (Japan) reported on progress made in the ""Box B"" group. She highlighted the remaining divergent positions on the issues of supplementarity, and said the EU had expressed interest in a possible qualitative ceiling. On fungibility and assigned amounts, she reported that India and the US were conducting consultations. On CDM, she said the majority opposed an indicative list of projects. She added that France, Korea, Brazil and Norway were working on the issue of a prompt start and that divergence remained on a possible unilateral CDM. Consultations were also being held between the US and India on the composition of the Executive Board, and between China, Norway and Canada on the possible role of multilateral funding institutions. In response to a question by the US on the allocation of the issue of sinks under the CDM, President Pronk said he would consult with the co-facilitators of both groups and then issue a ruling. The EU said that although there was a majority against it, the option of having a positive list of activities under the CDM should remain on the table."
573	2000	enb12154e	['United States']	On the annual or periodic reporting and review of Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse effects), Co-Chair Plume said the Co-Chairs would, with the participation of Saudi Arabia, the US and EU, consult with the Co-Chairs of the contact group on adverse effects and explain the difficulties in completing the guidelines without the latter group having finished its work.
324	2000	enb12159e	['United States']	Reacting to the US proposal, AOSIS said his group has a clear position on this subject, and that he looked forward to sharing it once the details of the US proposal were further clarified. BULGARIA, on behalf of the CENTRAL GROUP 11, said the Group would undertake to identify spokespersons for the individual issues by Tuesday, and would comment on President Pronks informal note once members had studied the document. Noting the importance of environmental integrity, JAPAN highlighted the need for rules to operationalize the Protocol and mobilize the private sector. SAUDI ARABIA said Annex I Parties should present their financial commitments during the high-level meeting on Tuesday morning.
592	2000	enb12156e	['Norway', 'Switzerland', 'United States']	On elements related to good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5.2 (adjustments), the G-77/CHINA suggested bracketing text on estimates of emissions and removals from LULUCF as the discussions in the group on LULUCF had not been concluded. NEW ZEALAND, with the EU, US and JAPAN, emphasized that such estimates from all sectors should be prepared under good practice guidance, and be adjusted when they are not prepared according to the agreed methodologies. In elements for a draft COP/MOP-1 decision on this matter, the EU, SWITZERLAND and NORWAY disagreed over a US proposal, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, NEW ZEALAND and AUSTRALIA, to include text on ensuring that adjustment procedures are conservative so that Parties would not be unduly penalised. The Co-Chairs requested interested Parties to meet to further discuss the unresolved paragraphs.
572	2000	enb12154e	['United States']	"On ""[initial] assigned amounts,"" the US and JAPAN stressed that the terminology was dependent on the outcome of the mechanisms group. BRAZIL, supported by the G-77/CHINA, said the terminology was rather related to Protocol Article 3.1 (assigned amount) and stated that it will submit a written proposal clarifying the terminology. On the timing for reporting and review, discussions focused on the deadline for the submission of information under Article 7 and highlighted the linkages with the mechanisms group. The US, JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND and the EU supported 1 January 2007 as this deadline, while SAMOA preferred the year 2005 so as to allow a pre-first commitment period review and determination of eligibility to participate in the mechanisms. The EU and NEW ZEALAND said the possibility of this participation provided a sufficient incentive for Parties to submit information earlier than 1 January 2007."
373	2000	enb12160e	['Canada']	"CANADA advocated for maximum flexibility in the use of mechanisms to ensure that the necessary resources are provided. FINLAND said the mechanisms must be transparent and reliable and not be a tool for printing ""forged money"" for environmental credits."
575	2000	enb12154e	['United States']	Chair Romro asked delegates not to reopen discussions on unbracketed text in subsequent discussions. The EU, US and JAPAN supported this proposal, while SAUDI ARABIA and VENEZULA opposed it. SAUDI ARABIA rejected the Chairs proposal to establish a Friends of the Chair group to develop compromise text, and threatened to withdraw support for a similar proposal in the contact group on mechanisms. The contact group will reconvene on Wednesday.
574	2000	enb12154e	['United States']	On demonstrable progress, the EU expressed support for a strong obligation for each Party to demonstrate, in its national communication, progress in meeting its commitments by 2005. SAMOA requested clarification on how to indicate demonstrable progress by 2005 if the Protocol has not already entered into force by that time. The US said that it did not support a separate reporting system for demonstrable progress beyond what is currently required to be included in the national communications.
568	2000	enb12154e	['Russia', 'United States']	Co-Chair Neroni Slade (Samoa) introduced a revised text based on intersessional consultations following SB-13 Part 1. On the inclusion of principles within the text, the G-77/CHINA, opposed by the US and JAPAN, urged their retention, noting that a number of the proposed principles are not set out in UNFCCC Article 3 (principles). On the plenary of the Compliance Committee, the G-77/CHINA, opposed by the US, EU, AUSTRALIA, RUSSIAN FEDERATION and NEW ZEALAND, said it should have an allocation as well as a preliminary examination function. She also proposed that the plenary be co-chaired by the Chairs of the facilitation and enforcement branches, as an alternative to having a bureau.
569	2000	enb12154e	['United States']	"On the mandate of the facilitation branch, the EU, with the US, AUSTRALIA and NEW ZEALAND, and opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, CHINA and the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, said cases should be dealt with on their merits and not on the basis of the Party involved. On the mandate of the enforcement branch, the G-77/CHINA stated the branch should only deal with Annex I Parties. The EU, JAPAN and the US said the references to ""Annex I Party"" could be deleted since the articles falling into the scope of that branch only applied to Annex I Parties and since non-Annex I Parties were not submitted to host-country requirements under the CDM. SAUDI ARABIA and the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, opposed by SAMOA and JAPAN, said Article 3.14 (adverse effects) was enforceable. NEW ZEALAND suggested adding that the branch would determine whether ""a Party is or is not meeting any requirement under Articles 5.2 (adjustments), 7.1 (inventories) and 7.4 (guidelines for the submission of information) relating to the issuance of assigned amount under Article 3.3 (afforestation, reforestation and deforestation) and 3.4 (additional activities)."" INDIA, SAMOA and BRAZIL expressed concern at this new proposal."
474	2000	enb12157e	['Canada', 'United States']	"POLICIES AND MEASURES (P&Ms): Delegates discussed the draft decision on P&Ms in two sessions of the contact group, and also during informal consultations held throughout the day. In the first contact group in the morning, discussions focused primarily on revised text relating to the decision that future work on P&Ms should facilitate an assessment of ""demonstrable progress"" of Annex I Parties in achieving their Protocol commitments. CANADA argued that this issue is being examined in the contact group on Articles 5, 7 and 8. With the support of JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and the US, and opposed by the G-77/CHINA and the EU, he proposed replacing the decision and its associated initiatives with alternative text stating that consideration of demonstrable progress cannot take place until the SBSTA has considered the issue pursuant to the guidelines that may be elaborated under Article 7. Although opposing retention of the listed initiatives, JAPAN, the US and AUSTRALIA, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, also provided amendments to the existing text in case it should be retained, including: replacing text on the assessment of demonstrable progress by 2005 with a request to Parties to ""continue sharing information""; replacing the requirement to assess and minimize the adverse effects of P&Ms with a requirement to facilitate information sharing on this issue; and bracketing reference to the use of ""quantitative criteria"" in reporting on P&Ms in national communications."
576	2000	enb12154e	['United States']	On technology needs assessment, the EU supported referring to existing activities and to reporting. TRINIDAD & TOBAGO preferred a broader reference to environmentally-sound technology rather than specifying mitigation and adaptation technologies. On the use of experts, the EU said it would be difficult to charge experts with defining country-driven approaches. The US said the experts should work on guidelines for developing such approaches.
577	2000	enb12154e	['United States']	"CAPACITY BUILDING IN COUNTRIES WITH ECONOMIES IN TRANSITION: Delegates cleared all of the legal and most of the substantive issues contained in the draft decision as well as the framework for capacity building in economies in transition. The US and EU requested that text on the provision of financial and technical support for the implementation of the framework through the ""GEF within its mandate"" be bracketed. Co-Chair Uosukainen said he would consult on a proposal by the EU to include Protocol Article 10 (existing commitments) in the preamble of the draft decision. In concluding the session, he expressed satisfaction with the progress achieved and added that he would consult with the Bureau on how the remaining issues should be resolved."
571	2000	enb12154e	['United States']	On first order problems, GERMANY and the US, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, suggested including reference to this issue in the draft decision on Article 7 rather than in the guidelines under this article. The US explained that annual reports include information on both inventories and the assigned amount and, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, suggested that first-order problems only refer to the former.
475	2000	enb12157e	['Canada', 'United States']	On the preamble, the US and CANADA, opposed by the G-77/ CHINA, urged deleting text recalling UNFCCC Articles 4.1 (commitments for all Parties), 4.2 (Annex I commitments), 4.8 (adverse effects) and 4.9 (least developed countries), and Protocol Articles 2 (P&Ms), 3.2 (demonstrable progress), 3.14 (adverse effects) and 7 (communication of information). The EU proposed adding reference to UNFCCC Article 7.2(b) (exchange of information on measures) and 7.2(c) (co-ordination of measures), and Protocol Articles 13.4(c) (exchange of information on measures), 13.4(d) (co-ordination of measures), and bracketed reference to UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects), and Protocol Article 7.
570	2000	enb12154e	['Canada', 'United States']	On the procedures to be followed, the US, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES and SAMOA opposed text allowing flexibility to the enforcement branch in the application of the consequences for economies in transition. On sources of information, the EU, US, CANADA and NEW ZEALAND opposed a suggestion by SAUDI ARABIA to delete reference to NGOs and IGOs.
323	2000	enb12159e	['United States']	"Jacques Chirac, President of France, said he had come to The Hague with a sense of urgency to make progress. He stated that since 1992, Parties had fallen too far behind in taking actions to combat climate change, and cautioned against further delays. Suggesting that ""everyone is waiting for someone else to make the first move"" in negotiations, he highlighted that the US produces a quarter of the worlds emissions, and that the per capita US levels of emissions are three times higher than those of France. He called on the US to join other industrialized nations in making a successful transition to an energy-efficient economy. He said the EU had a duty to set an example by developing more economical forms of consumption and production in terms of natural resources. He also stated the intention of the EU member States to ratify the Protocol in 2002."
476	2000	enb12157e	['Canada', 'United States']	The contact group reconvened in the evening to consider revised Co-Chairs text that sought to provide for informal consultations that occurred in the afternoon. On the preamble, the US, JAPAN and CANADA, opposed by the EU, SAUDI ARABIA and SAMOA, again urged deleting reference to specific UNFCCC and Protocol provisions. These remained bracketed.
380	2000	enb12160e	['Russia', 'Kazakhstan']	BULGARIA, for CENTRAL GROUP ELEVEN, and supported by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, CHINA and KAZAKHSTAN, for the GROUP OF NINE an alliance of Central Asian and Trans-Caucasian countries, and Moldova underlined that economies in transition are, like developing countries, in need of financial aid from the GEF for the purpose of capacity building, technology transfer and responding to adverse effects, and requested the removal of the brackets around text on their needs. BELIZE said that the question of whether capacity building should be considered under adaptation should not be difficult to resolve, and supported mandatory language in decisions.
322	2000	enb12153e	['Norway', 'United States']	On other CDM issues, SAUDI ARABIA recalled that several Parties had objected to a prompt start. NORWAY, AUSTRALIA and the US highlighted the need to streamline the text on participation. The US underlined the issue of baselines. The EU urged streamlining text on validation particularly as regards baselines.
384	2000	enb12160e	['Russia', 'Canada', 'United States']	"The G-77/CHINA, AFRICA GROUP and SAMOA, opposed by US, CANADA, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, urged the establishment of an adaptation fund based on a levy applied to all three mechanisms. On the proposal to levy a ""share of proceeds"" on Protocol Article 6 (JI) and Article 12 (emissions trading), the RUSSIAN FEDERATION expressed willingness to discuss this possibility only under certain conditions. HUNGARY said he strongly disagreed with this proposal. JAPAN, opposed by CHINA and INDONESIA, supported using ODA funding for the CDM."
381	2000	enb12160e	['Canada', 'United States']	"CANADA, with the US and EU, emphasized support for the GEF. He recognized that developing countries might find it too slow and therefore supported enhancing its functioning. FINLAND said the GEF is not the only funding channel, and stressed the availability of bilateral and private sector funds. AOSIS supported retaining the GEF as the financial mechanism, but stated that it needed improving and strengthening. SOUTH AFRICA opposed the ""dumping"" of unwanted technology by developed countries in developing countries. CHINA called for concrete progress, stating that negotiating partners are stalling."
75	2000	enb12155e	['United States']	On the decision inviting international organizations to present a status report on their activities relating to P&Ms, the US, supported by the EU and AUSTRALIA, proposed that this should be integrated within the decision requesting the Secretariat to support future work. The G-77/CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA and BRAZIL urged keeping this as a separate decision, noting that it included additional proposals. Parties did not reach agreement on this issue.
379	2000	enb12160e	['Russia']	Adjournment of the meeting: Following a request to Plenary earlier in the evening by President Pronk - which he indicated had been endorsed by Ministers - interpretation services for the formal session ended at 9:00p.m, with interpreters moving to cover parallel informal high-level negotiations. Several delegates, including the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and SPAIN, objected to the removal of interpretation services. The Plenary was therefore adjourned until Wednesday morning, when formal statements by Parties will resume.
378	2000	enb12160e	['Armenia']	Economies in transition (EITs): FINLAND said a comprehensive negotiation package should also address the concerns of EITs. ARMENIA said EITs have a particular challenge in moving toward a market economy without increasing their greenhouse gas emissions and said this transition should be guided by the principles of sustainable development.
69	2000	enb12155e	['United States']	Regarding the section of the text on Accounting Specific to Article 3.3, the EU, US, PERU and TUVALU called for symmetry in terms of credits for afforestation and reforestation on one hand and debits for deforestation on the other.
72	2000	enb12155e	['United States']	"On reporting of supplementary information under Article 7, the EU proposed text for a section on ""domestic programmes,"" which requires reporting on domestic policies and measures as well as on the domestic system for monitoring legal entities participation in international emissions trading. SAMOA supported this text, while the US, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN and NEW ZEALAND opposed it."
71	2000	enb12155e	['United States']	"Regarding issuance and cancellation of assigned amounts (AA) related to Protocol Article 3.3 and 3.4, the G-77/CHINA, supported by the EU and US, suggested referring to ""additions"" and ""subtractions"" from AA in the guidelines under Article 7. Opposed by NEW ZEALAND and supported by INDIA, he added that, pending agreement of this issue in the LULUCF group, any reference to Article 3.4 should be bracketed. Co-Chair Newton Paciornik (Brazil) said the Co-Chairs would consult on this issue with the Co-Chairs of the contact group on LULUCF. In the guidelines under Article 8, the G-77/CHINA suggested deleting Part III on the review of information on AA. INDIA explained that AA are fixed amounts and therefore cannot be reviewed, however the information on additions and subtractions would be reviewed. BRAZIL, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, then introduced a text for a new Part III bis that addresses the terminology ""initial AA"" and replaces it with ""amounts that contribute to the compliance of a Party included in Annex I with the quantified emission limitation and reduction commitment under Article 3."""
70	2000	enb12155e	['United States']	"PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8: On reporting under Articles 10 (existing commitments) and 11 (financial mechanism), the G-77/CHINA, opposed by the US and EU, said Annex I Parties should also be requested to report on the implementation of their commitments related to the transfer of technologies and the provision of ""new and additional"" financial resources."
477	2000	enb12157e	['United States']	On the decision relating to demonstrable progress, Co-Chair Muyungi (Tanzania) proposed presenting three broad options for consideration next week. The US and AUSTRALIA underlined that there were four possible options. SAUDI ARABIA urged the retention of bracketed text, rather than presenting different options. AUSTRALIA and the US, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA and the EU, proposed deleting chapeau language on an assessment of demonstrable progress. Delegates failed to resolve the issue of whether to present text on demonstrable progress in the form of options, or as consolidated bracketed text.
382	2000	enb12160e	['Russia', 'Canada', 'United States']	"MECHANISMS: In the informal high-level Plenary held in the afternoon, ministers and senior officials presented their views on the outstanding ""crunch issues"" on mechanisms identified by President Pronk. On the issue of supplementarity, JAPAN and the US urged against renegotiating the Protocol. While recognizing the need for flexibility, the EU drew attention to the importance of domestic action. INDONESIA argued in favor of requiring 70% of emissions reductions through domestic action, with the possibility of this being reduced under certain conditions. HUNGARY and the AFRICA GROUP, opposed by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and AUSTRALIA, advocated implementation of a quantitative limitation on the flexibility mechanisms. CANADA underlined its flexibility on this issue. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA, opposed by HUNGARY and CHINA, argued in favor of host-generated unilateral CDM projects. COLOMBIA and BOLIVIA proposed provision for bilateral, multilateral and unilateral CDM projects."
73	2000	enb12155e	['United States']	On the paragraph addressing implementation of technology needs and needs assessment, the EU noted that differences of opinion remained over the timing for SBSTAs consideration on this matter, and on whether a fixed date should be set. Citing the possible need for confidentiality of information, the PHILIPPINES opposed a suggestion to make available such information through national communications. The US supported the use of national communications. The contact group adjourned to continue deliberations in the two smaller drafting groups.
68	2000	enb12155e	['Norway']	"On additional activities during the first commitment period, the EU, TUVALU, CHINA, NORWAY and MALAYSIA, opposed by JAPAN, said these should not be pursued. TUVALU and the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP requested deletion of text that would allow Parties to ""elect"" the activities under Article 3.4 to be included in the first commitment period. On additional activities during the second and subsequent commitment periods, the EU, NORWAY, TUVALU and MALAYSIA, opposed by JAPAN, said the COP should establish a list prior to the second commitment period. AUSTRALIA suggested introducing text ensuring definitional and accounting consistencies between first and subsequent commitment periods. The ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP supported a full carbon accounting system that would not require the listing of activities, while COLOMBIA expressed concern with an activity-based approach and proposed a symmetrical approach."
385	2000	enb12160e	['Russia', 'Canada', 'United States']	On sinks in the CDM, the US, CANADA, JAPAN, COSTA RICA, AUSTRALIA, COLOMBIA, HONDURAS and BOLIVIA, opposed by the EU, CHINA and GHANA, argued in favor of including sinks. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION suggested that the decision on including sinks be deferred for possible inclusion in the next commitment period. HONDURAS, SAUDI ARABIA and HUNGARY argued against inclusion of nuclear power in the CDM. AUSTRALIA said this issue should be for individual developing countries to decide, and underlined that US silence on the matter did not necessarily indicate a lack of support for the issue.
76	2000	enb12155e	['Russia', 'Canada', 'Switzerland', 'United States']	Delegates commented on the Co-Chairs draft proposals presenting three options for the adoption of procedures and mechanisms on compliance. The G-77/CHINA, supported by several members of its group, said it was premature to decide on one option since the mode of adoption depends on the content of the procedures and mechanisms. However, she added that there was clearly a need for legally-binding consequences and that consequently Protocol Article 18, which refers to an amendment, would need to be taken into account. JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, opposed by the US and CANADA, supported adoption by a decision. SWITZERLAND and NEW ZEALAND said adoption should be through a COP-6 decision adopting an agreement becoming an integral part of the Protocol, while the EU favored the option whereby the agreement would be adopted at COP-7.
478	2000	enb12157e	['United States']	PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8: Delegates in this contact group convened to continue consideration of the Co-Chairs working paper containing draft decisions under Articles 5, 7 and 8 as well as draft guidelines under Articles 7 and 8. On the draft COP/ MOP-1 decision related to Article 5.2 (adjustments), the US suggested that adjustments applying to a Partys base-year inventory estimates could not be replaced by revised estimates subsequent to the establishment of a Partys initial assigned amounts. The G-77/CHINA, opposed by the EU, said inventory estimates of a year during the commitment period that had been adjusted should not be revised and that consequently, adjustments of estimates of both the base year inventory and the inventory during the commitment period could not be revised.
383	2000	enb12160e	['Canada', 'United States']	The EU, supported by HUNGARY, and opposed by JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, the US, CANADA and SAUDI ARABIA, underlined its preference for a positive list. She argued that the aim of the positive list is to assist in getting the CDM started in support of sustainable projects, and that the list would be subject to review. The G-77/CHINA argued that the host developing country should be the sole judge in deciding on the project. The US expressed flexibility on the potential for small projects, on condition that there is no positive list and that sinks are included.
74	2000	enb12155e	['Canada', 'United States']	"POLICIES AND MEASURES (P&Ms): Delegates resumed discussion on the elements for a draft decision on ""best practices"" or ""good practices"" in P&Ms among Annex I Parties. On the decision requesting the Secretariat, under the guidance of the Chair of the SBSTA and in collaboration with relevant international and intergovernmental organisations, to support future work on P&Ms by organizing, inter alia, workshops and side events, the EU, supported by the US, CANADA and JAPAN, proposed removing reference to specific international organizations. The G-77/CHINA and SAUDI ARABIA urged retaining reference to the specific organizations, and particularly OPEC. Reference to the international organizations was bracketed. Delegates agreed that the Secretariat operate under the guidance of the SBSTA, rather than the SBSTA Chair."
481	2000	enb12157e	['United States']	Regarding text on a framework for capacity building for developing countries that refers to a special fund to support implementation of this framework by the LDCs, the US said he believed that many elements of this framework are relevant for GEF funding, although some may not be. On draft text stating that Annex II Parties should provide financial and technical resources for country-level needs assessments and for the development of specific capacity building activities consistent with the capacity building framework, the EU indicated that at this stage it did not see the need for a new fund outside of the GEF.
386	2000	enb12160e	['Norway', 'United States', 'United Kingdom']	LULUCF: Delegates met from 9:00 pm to discuss LULUCF. The UK, for the EU, responded to the US proposal made on Monday for phasing in credits for activities under Article 3.4. He said the EU accepts the concept of carbon sinks, especially forests, but, with the CENTRAL GROUP ELEVEN and NORWAY, stressed problems associated with permanence, uncertainty, risk, additionality and especially scale as it relates to the Umbrella Group proposal. The US reiterated its position on the need to include sinks during the first commitment period and said its proposal provided flexibility and was based on a long-term perspective. He illustrated the potential scale of Article 3.4 activities, and said Parties have the ability to make accurate estimates. The ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP said it was somewhat reassured by the statement of US regarding their proposal, and stressed the need for verifiability and additionality. The G-77/ CHINA stressed its principles on LULUCF and the need to exclude credits for natural uptake. The US, with JAPAN, said natural effects cannot be factored out in a satisfactory manner, and said the effect of carbon fertilization is well under 10%. TUVALU and ARGENTINA questioned whether a final decision on Article 3.4 was appropriate at COP-6. An informal group, facilitated by Mexico and Slovakia and assisted by the Co-Chairs of the LULUCF contact group, was convened.
254	2000	enb12152e	['Norway', 'Ukraine', 'United States', 'Russia', 'Canada']	"Another contentious issue is whether there should be a limit or ceiling on how much of a countrys emissions reduction target can be met through the mechanisms. According to the Protocol, use of the mechanisms should be supplemental to domestic policies and measures. The EU, with support from some developing countries, has taken the position that a definite ceiling should be imposed on using the mechanisms, so that they contribute to reaching no more than 50% of a countrys emissions reduction target. The introduction of a ceiling is opposed by countries belonging to the ""Umbrella Group"" a loose alliance of Annex 1 Parties that includes the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, Norway, the Russian Federation and Ukraine as well as by some developing countries."
480	2000	enb12157e	['United States']	"BRAZIL, for the G-77/CHINA, said he could not accept the deletion of the preambular Principles, and CHINA commented that too many options had been eliminated from the text. The US, EU, TUVALU, and PERU supported retention of the Principles. TUVALU, for AOSIS, expressed concern that the groups suggestions, in particular one regarding the biome approach to the definition of ""forest,"" had not been considered, and that the text as it stands was unbalanced."
479	2000	enb12157e	['United States']	On the guidelines under Article 8, delegates considered a US proposal, supported by the EU, to move Part III bis on the annual compilation and accounting of emission inventories and assigned amounts (AA) to the Article 7 guidelines. Parties could not reach agreement on this proposal, however. On a proposal by the G-77/ CHINA to delete Part III on the review of information on AA, the US said the guidelines should provide for review of information related to AA. The EU, opposed by NEW ZEALAND, added that if the information on the initial AA is put in the registries by the Secretariat, instead of by the Parties, there is no need for such a review. Co-Chair Paciornik informed delegates that the mechanisms group had decided that issues relating to registries had been allocated to the group on Articles 5, 7 and 8.
377	2000	enb12160e	['Canada']	"Funding / GEF: The need for additional resources to support developing countries to cope with climate change was highlighted by many speakers. Noting the need to reform the GEF, CANADA called for the creation of a ""window"" within the GEF to deal with special climate change issues such as adaptation. BENIN said the GEF should be equipped with additional resources. DENMARK called on the GEF to be more responsive to LDCs needs and proposed support equivalent to 0.1% of Gross National Products in additional funds. JAPAN said the widest possible range of resources should be mobilized, including ODA to ensure equitable distribution of CDM projects."
375	2000	enb12160e	['Norway']	Compliance: JAPAN said disagreements over the compliance regime should not delay the Protocols entry into force. NORWAY said a firm compliance regime is essential to ensure that the Protocol and its mechanisms will work. SAMOA, BRAZIL, INDONESIA and LUXEMBOURG called for strong and enforceable rules and procedures that penalize non-compliance.
374	2000	enb12160e	['Norway']	NEW ZEALAND, NORWAY, AUSTRIA, HONDURAS and COSTA RICA said nuclear power should not be permitted within the CDM. SAMOA said the CDM should promote investments on environmentally-safe renewable energy technologies. JAPAN said that developing countries judgment of what constitutes sustainable development should not be overruled by limiting the types of eligible activities under the CDM.
591	2000	enb12156e	['Canada', 'United States']	Regarding the decision that future work should enable an assessment of demonstrable progress of Annex I Parties in achieving their Protocol commitments, the G-77/CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA and the EU underlined the importance of this issue. The US stated that it was unable to continue discussion on this issue pending the outcome of deliberations in other contact groups. CANADA proposed deleting the decision. Delegates agreed to defer discussion on this issue. On the chapeau, the US, CANADA, AUSTRALIA and JAPAN, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, proposed deleting reference to specific provisions of the UNFCCC.
253	2000	enb12152e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'United States', 'Norway']	"Mechanisms: While negotiators in Kyoto agreed that the mechanisms developed under the Protocol could help developed countries lower the costs of meeting their national emissions targets, countries differ on the operational details governing the use of the mechanisms details that must be set at COP-6. Key decisions include the accounting rules for allocating credits, as well as the roles and responsibilities of various institutions. For the CDM and JI, countries must decide which projects are eligible and what the baselines are for measuring the emissions-reduction contribution of any specific project. A particularly controversial issue is whether to allow only projects that reduce emissions, or whether to include projects that remove existing or future carbon from the atmosphere carbon ""sinks"" projects such as reforestation. Although differing on the specific conditions, countries in favor of including sinks within the CDM include the US, Canada, Australia, Japan and Norway. Inclusion is also favored by the Environmental Integrity Group (a recently formed negotiating group comprising Switzerland, Mexico and the Republic of Korea), and some developing countries, such as Peru, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Bolivia and Uruguay. On the other side, the EU, as well as developing countries such as Tuvalu, Samoa, China and Jamaica, want sinks to be excluded from the CDM."
789	2001	enb12173e	['Canada']	"ARGENTINA expressed concern at these visa and accommodation difficulties. He suggested a small committee might be established to consider these issues, without being involved in micro-management. GERMANY said most difficulties have been addressed during the past one and a half years, and undertook to take all steps necessary to deal with problems as they arise. CANADA noted Argentinas ""interesting"" proposal but indicated some reservations."
43	2001	enb12179e	['Canada', 'United States']	NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS: On national communications from non-Annex I Parties, the SBI considered the third compilation and synthesis of initial communications. The US proposed that recommendations from the Consultative Group of Experts (CGE) be considered as a basis for improvements of the UNFCCC reporting guidelines. On the report of the CGE, CANADA, with AUSTRALIA, noted that there might be overlap between the report and the COP-6 Part II funding package, suggesting they be harmonized. The EU, with AUSTRALIA, and opposed by MALAYSIA, CHINA and ARGENTINA, said the report provided a sound basis to initiate the revised UNFCCC guidelines. ARGENTINA, PANAMA and BURKINA FASO underlined the need to integrate the preparation of national communications in the development process of host countries. Chair Ashe said this issue would be further considered in an informal group, along with the provision of financial and technical support.
45	2001	enb12181e	['Russia']	"Regarding the paragraph on general information to be reported for activities under Protocol Article 3.3 (afforestation, deforestation, reforestation) and 3.4 (additional activities), AUSTRALIA, supported by the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and EU, cautioned that in many instances the guideline text is more detailed than that contained in the draft decision on LULUCF from COP-6 Part II. He stressed that details should be left to be defined in the IPCC good practice guidance. SAUDI ARABIA proposed introducing additional subparagraphs requiring Parties to submit information on, inter alia, how the reported activities exclude carbon dioxide removals due to indirect human-induced effects. TUVALU stressed the need to reflect the Bonn Agreements, and not ""pick and choose"" what to retain in the guidelines. A drafting group on the guideline paragraphs dealing with LULUCF will be convened."
42	2001	enb12179e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'Norway']	Chair Dovland then invited participants to consider the implications of the TAR for the future work of the SBSTA and any requests to the IPCC. The EU, supported by JAPAN, CANADA, MALAYSIA, AOSIS, NORWAY, SWITZERLAND and AUSTRALIA, but opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, suggested holding a workshop on the implications of the TAR for the work of the SBSTA. With MAURITIUS, UGANDA and HUNGARY, he suggested consideration of outreach and wider communication of the TAR. SAUDI ARABIA and the G-77/CHINA stressed the inclusion of developing country scientists, and literature in languages other than English.
598	2001	enb12174e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	SAUDI ARABIA said these two documents are subject to negotiation, and are not a part of what was adopted in the decision. He argued that it would be unacceptable to re-open settled matters. The G-77/CHINA, supported by numerous member countries, as well as the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, CG-11, the EU, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, and the US, underlined the importance of safeguarding the integrity of the political agreement reached on Monday. The EU and SWITZERLAND requested that the joint Political Declaration on finance be included in the conference report. JAPAN also requested that note be taken of its statement on finance. SAUDI ARABIA, AUSTRALIA and the US emphasized the need to rely on the text of the UNFCCC and Protocol when there is any doubt with regard to the political decision.
790	2001	enb12173e	['United States']	BRAZILIAN PROPOSAL: On Brazils proposal on reductions toward an overall emission ceiling for Annex I Parties allocated on the basis of each Partys relative share of responsibility for climate change, Chair Dovland said a workshop had been held to identify scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal. The EU noted progress in addressing the technical basis of the proposal, but identified several outstanding issues. CHINA, supported by BRAZIL, SAUDI ARABIA and INDIA, warned that the work should not go beyond the COPs mandate. The US noted the workshops narrow focus, called for consideration of other models and indicators, and supported continued research. Chair Dovland said informal consultations on draft conclusions would be undertaken.
30	2001	enb12185e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'Norway']	Revisiting SAMOAs proposal for the consideration of stakeholders in the Executive Boards project reviews, CANADA and JAPAN, opposed by the EU and SWITZERLAND, proposed that it be the Boards responsibility to elaborate procedures for triggering reviews. NORWAY called for further consultations. On the election of the Board, SAMOA, with the EU and BULGARIA, called for consideration of gender balance.
799	2001	enb12167e	['United States']	"On text requesting the GEF to provide funding for the implementation of the capacity building framework, the G-77/CHINA suggested that the language agreed upon in the draft decision on capacity building should replace the current text. The US, with the EU, preferred working on the basis of the current text. The US also expressed concern at placing all responsibility of implementation on the GEF, proposing instead that this entity ""support the implementation,"" rather than ""implement,"" the framework. Co-Chair Ashe suggested both texts be discussed at a later stage, and expressed concern at the lack of significant progress."
788	2001	enb12173e	['Russia', 'Norway', 'Canada']	ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS: On administrative and financial matters, SBI first considered the financial performance for 2000-2001. The Secretariat highlighted that a revised indicative list of contributions was presented for 2001, pursuant to the adoption by the UN General Assembly in 2000 of a revised scale of assessment. He noted the special annual contribution of DM 3.5 million made by the host government. CANADA, NORWAY, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and LATVIA expressed concern over the fact that, contrary to indications contained in the document on the status of contributions, they had taken the necessary steps to make their 2001 contributions. The G-77/CHINA said the relevant UN General Assembly resolution provides that the revised scale should not automatically affect the scale of assessment of other UN bodies. Chair Ashe said a draft decision would be prepared on this issue.
800	2001	enb12167e	['Canada', 'Norway']	In the evening, delegates met to discuss the negotiating text on adverse effects, starting with Section A under adverse effects of climate change. NORWAY, supported by CANADA and the EU, suggested using President Pronks consolidated negotiating text for the discussions. Participants discussed the implications of relying on sources of information other than national communications to carry out an assessment and evaluation to determine action related to adaptation. The G-77/CHINA supported using other relevant information, and underscored their commitment to carrying out national communications, despite limited resources and capacity. Many Annex I Parties expressed concern at making language on the source of this information too vague.
41	2001	enb12179e	['Norway']	ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS: SBSTA Chair Harald Dovland (Norway) opened the first meeting of SBSTAs fifteenth session. Regarding the agenda, the EU requested consideration of decision 17/CP.5 containing operational parts on the consideration by Parties and SBSTA on limiting emissions of hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons. He further underscored an EU proposal on terms of reference to develop definitions and modalities for including afforestation and deforestation projects under the CDM in the first commitment period for consideration at SBSTA-15. MALAYSIA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, noted that this was premature since the rules and modalities of the CDM were being discussed separately and had not been completed. Chair Dovland said the EU proposal would be distributed.
334	2001	enb12172e	['Norway', 'Iceland', 'Switzerland', 'United States', 'Canada']	The EU said the agreement was historic and, with the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, stressed that it was very positive for the international community. He said the door had been left open for a country that considers that the Protocol is not the best tool to address climate change, to join at a later stage. He then read the text of a Political Declaration submitted by the EU, Canada, Iceland, Norway, New Zealand and Switzerland on funding to developing countries, which includes an engagement to provide an annual contribution of US$ 410 million by 2005.
111	2001	enb12180e	['Switzerland']	TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER: On the development and transfer of technologies, delegates considered the technology information system, which includes an inventory of environmentally sound technologies and a prototype web-based clearinghouse. SWITZERLAND and the EU supported holding an expert meeting. The G-77/CHINA encouraged continued funding. SAUDI ARABIA, supported by CHINA, PERU and PANAMA, stressed the need for actual transfer of technology in addition to information. Chair Dovland said informal consultations would be held to prepare draft conclusions.
802	2001	enb12167e	['Norway']	"On accreditation and designation of operational entities, NORWAY supported Pronks text subject to ""minor technical issues."" SAMOA and TANZANIA underlined concerns with the inclusion of sinks in the CDM. The EU said the sinks issue must be decided at a high political level."
801	2001	enb12167e	['Canada']	"SAUDI ARABIA expressed concern at the lack of progress, stressing the need to have sufficient time to negotiate all the ""developing country"" issues that had been placed in this negotiating group by President Pronk. CANADA, with the EU, disagreed that no progress had been made."
238	2001	enb12186e	['Turkey', 'Kazakhstan']	SBI met in the afternoon to resume consideration of its agenda. On organizational matters, delegates elected Daniela Stoytcheva (Bulgaria) as SBI Vice-Chair and Emily Ojoo-Massawa (Kenya) as SBI Rapporteur. On matters referred to the SBI by the COP, delegates adopted the draft conclusions on the report of the GEF. The SBI then agreed to recommend to the COP a decision amending the Annex II list by removing Turkey and inviting Parties to recognize its special circumstances as an Annex I Party. On Kazakhstans proposal to add its name to Annex I, the SBI adopted conclusions whereby the COP notes that Kazakhstan, inter alia, becomes an Annex I Party for the purposes of the Protocol upon ratification.
239	2001	enb12186e	['Canada']	"COMPLIANCE: The negotiating group on compliance met in an evening session to consider the new Co-Chairs non-paper on compliance, an ""EU/Umbrella Group proposed compliance package,"" as well as new text for a draft COP decision. CANADA introduced the package proposal, highlighting that it focused on trigger, appeal, compliance action plan and suspension of eligibility to make transfers under Article 17. The G-77/CHINA and the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP supported the package. The NETHERLANDS then reported on the outcome of consultations on outstanding issues not reflected in the Co-Chairs new non-paper. On the mandate of the facilitative branch, he reported agreement on the deletion of wording specifying that it was ""the only branch"" responsible for addressing questions of implementation. On the consequences applied by the facilitative branch, he said delegates had agreed that these be applied ""taking into account,"" rather than ""on the basis of,"" the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Delegates agreed to the new Co-Chairs non-paper on procedures and mechanisms, as amended. Everton Vargas (Brazil) then reported on consultations he facilitated on the draft COP decision and recommended that the group adopt his proposed draft decision, with an editorial amendment. Delegates agreed, thus completing the work of the negotiating group."
413	2001	enb12188e	['Russia']	The INDIGENOUS PEOPLES ORGANIZATIONS noted that there are 350 million indigenous peoples in the world, with many being extremely vulnerable to climate change. She requested a COP decision to grant indigenous peoples a specific status in the climate change process, and said it should create an ad hoc intersessional open-ended working group. GLOBAL LEGISLATORS ORGANIZATION FOR A BALANCED ENVIRONMENT supported a rigorous compliance system, limits on the use of sinks, and a CDM that involves as many developing countries and LDCs as possible, and that includes small-scale projects. He supported active public procurement policies to bring prices down for renewable energy and called for technology leap-frogging. CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK NORTH linked climate change to health and poverty issues. She said Parties should not reopen agreed limits on the use of sinks, and sinks credits must not be carried into the next commitment period. Noting that she was from a Russian NGO, she said the Russian Federation will benefit from participation in the Protocol, and highlighted a statement by President Putin stating that he would be cooperating with the EU with a view to early ratification and entry into force.
113	2001	enb12180e	['Russia', 'Canada', 'United States']	The EU, supported by INDONESIA, proposed that the SBSTA develop terms of reference for IPCC work on CDM modalities for LULUCF during its current session. The US, RUSSIAN FEDERATION, CANADA and AUSTRALIA cautioned that the draft decision on LULUCF has yet to be finalized. AOSIS stressed that issues related to Articles 5, 7 and 8 need to be resolved before further guidance is given to the IPCC, and supported broader consultation. The matter will be further examined in informal consultations.
236	2001	enb12186e	['Uzbekistan']	"On organizational matters, delegates elected Philip Weech (the Bahamas) as SBSTA Vice-Chair and Tatyana Ososkova (Uzbekistan) as SBSTA Rapporteur. On methods to evaluate impacts and adaptation, the conclusions were amended to include reference to ""global and regional"" international organizations. The conclusions on issues relating to hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons were amended to provide for Chinas proposal that only ""Annex I"" Parties be encouraged to update information on means for limiting such emissions. The conclusions relating to Canadas proposal on cleaner or less greenhouse gas emitting energy were adopted, with the EU emphasizing the need for well defined terms of reference for the workshop."
509	2001	enb12170e	['United States']	A number of Parties then made general statements. IRAN, for the G-77/CHINA, expressed concern with the unilateral approach of the US, and emphasized: preference for three separate decisions on mechanisms; the need to address adverse effects; support for legally binding consequences of non-compliance; and the need for further negotiations on LULUCF. BELGIUM, for the EU, said it is ready for compromises with all Parties to reach agreement on a balanced package that respects: environmental integrity; equity and solidarity with developing countries; and economic efficiency and flexibility in meeting the agreed targets. SAMOA, for AOSIS, emphasized the need for additional funds to undertake adaptation. The CZECH REPUBLIC, for CG-11, expressed concern with the Pronk text on financial obligations for Parties included in Annex I and not included in Annex II, and with proposals for a levy on joint implementation and emissions trading. MOROCCO expressed his hope that COP-7 would provide renewed impetus ahead of the Johannesburg 2002 Summit.
112	2001	enb12180e	['Switzerland']	Bunker fuels: Taka Hiraishi, IPCC Inventories Task Force Bureau, noted that the IPCC good practice guidance aims to complement the revised 1996 IPCC greenhouse gas reporting guidelines and includes a chapter on bunker fuels. The EU reiterated concerns about increasing greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation and called for guidelines compatible with the Protocol for emissions allocation methodologies. He urged the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to work on emissions reductions activities. SWITZERLAND proposed that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council continue initiatives on guidelines on emissions reductions. The G-77/CHINA proposed that work take place within the framework of Protocol Article 2.2, which stipulates that Annex I Parties shall limit emissions from aviation and marine bunker fuels, working through the ICAO and IMO. Informal consultations will be held.
237	2001	enb12186e	['Canada', 'Switzerland']	On P&Ms, the EU proposed reference to the October 2001 workshop report, rather than to its terms of reference. SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by POLAND, SWITZERLAND, CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC and CANADA, advocated deleting a paragraph inviting Parties to consider and submit their views on the workshop, and on further action to advance the work on P&Ms. Following discussion, the original conclusions were adopted, with the EU expressing reluctance in doing so.
803	2001	enb12167e	['Norway', 'Switzerland', 'United States']	"On eligibility, Co-Chair Estrada noted that this was completely reformulated in the Pronk text, which aimed to combine the various options. JAPAN proposed deleting the notion of project eligibility. NORWAY, SWITZERLAND, the REPUBLIC OF KOREA and the EU expressed general support for the Pronk proposal. The EU and CHINA requested including reference to CDM being a partnership between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. JAPAN, NIGERIA and the US expressed concern with the requirement that an Annex I Partys use of CERs is conditional on it being a Party to the ""Agreement on Procedures and Mechanisms on Compliance supplementing the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC."" SAMOA said she could not consider the principle that there be resumed eligibility after a certain time has elapsed."
804	2001	enb12167e	['Canada']	"On validation and registration, the EU supported the Pronk text as a good basis for negotiation. AUSTRALIA, JAPAN and CANADA opposed text requiring environmental impact assessments for every project activity. AUSTRALIA and JAPAN, opposed by SAMOA, disagreed with preferential treatment on the crediting period for small-scale project activities. CHINA urged provision for technology transfer and environmental additionality. TUVALU proposed bracketing reference to leakage. On supplementarity, NIGERIA sought clarity on reference to Annex I Parties meeting emissions reduction commitments ""chiefly"" through domestic action, and underlined the importance of equitable geographic distribution of CDM projects. Delegates did not complete discussions on monitoring, verification and certification, and issuance of certified emission reductions."
335	2001	enb12172e	['Canada']	"AUSTRALIA said the Umbrella Group would meet its responsibilities. CANADA announced that it would allocate ten million dollars to jump-start the fund to help meet the adaptation needs of LDCs. CHINA thanked the EU and others for their Political Declaration and said the agreement had demonstrated that, in times of crisis, the international community continues to move in the right direction. JAPAN expressed pleasure in joining the consensus that constitutes a vital step towards realizing the entry into force of the Protocol by 2002. She added that a global effort is needed to achieve the Protocols objectives. CG-11 said individual members promised to do their best to engage the Protocol ratification process and hoped the ""skeptical"" country would join the global endeavor."
114	2001	enb12180e	['Canada']	Emissions from forest harvesting and wood products (HWP): The EU noted a proposal to develop approaches and methodologies supporting the use of sustainably produced wood in replacing energy intensive materials and fossil fuels. The EU, supported by AOSIS, CHINA and SAUDI ARABIA, opposed the inclusion of HWP in the first commitment period. NEW ZEALAND noted slow progress on the development of technical methodologies and, supported by JAPAN, CANADA and MALAYSIA, suggested further technical review. Informal consultations will be held.
336	2001	enb12172e	['United States']	"A profound sense of relief swept the corridors late Monday morning as it finally emerged that Ministers and other high-level officials had achieved a result in Bonn on key political issues after ""marathon"" talks. While many bleary-eyed observers were noting that this text involved many compromises, especially on the part of the EU and the G-77/China, most seemed elated that an agreement had been reached, even if the general perception was that it was not as strong as it could have been. Some participants noted that, with the US no longer in the Protocol picture, the remaining Umbrella Group members had ""held all the cards"" coming into these talks, meaning that a result generally favoring their positions on key issues such as sinks, compliance and funding was always likely if a deal was to be struck at all. Several participants also suggested that this outcome was a ""victory for multilateralism."""
31	2001	enb12185e	['Russia']	On guidelines for implementation of Article 6, SAMOA and the G-77/CHINA expressed concern with the early start of projects and their eligibility for ERUs as of 2008. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION and EU said the decision was in line with the Protocol provisions. The issue was forwarded to informal consultations. On administrative costs of Article 6 activities, the EU opposed SAMOAs proposal that procedural costs be considered prior to the establishment of the JI Supervisory Committee. The discussion was referred to informal consultations.
32	2001	enb12185e	['Canada', 'Switzerland']	"On Article 17, Parties failed to reach agreement on several elements relating to the commitment period reserve, including whether to consider ERUs and CERs for the first commitment period. Delegates agreed to revisit the draft decisions pending deliberations on Article 7.4. AUSTRALIA, JAPAN and CANADA said that Parties, upon establishment of their assigned amount and until expiration of the additional period for fulfilling commitments, ""should"" not make a transfer resulting in these holdings falling below the required commitment period reserve level. The EU, G-77/CHINA, SAMOA and SWITZERLAND supported the use of ""shall."" SWITZERLAND noted the need for mandatory requirements to maintain the integrity of the Bonn Agreements. The issue was forwarded to ministers. On the actions to be taken if calculations raise a Partys ""required"" level of commitment period reserve above the Partys holdings of ERUs, CERs and AAUs, AUSTRALIA and CANADA supported reference to ""recommended"" level. Co-Chair Chow, supported by the EU and G-77/ CHINA, urged reference to ""required."" The issue was forwarded to ministers, noting that Co-Chair Chows proposal enjoyed majority support."
333	2001	enb12172e	['Russia', 'Ukraine']	"Minister Peter Hodgson (New Zealand) reported on his consultations on the mechanisms. He said that although no explicit agreement had been reached, progress on some matters had been made, in particular with the introduction of new text that ""might fly."" On supplementarity, he said the EU had ""moved big distances."" He reported that he had suggested text that: includes a reference to ""significant"" as an elaboration of the term ""supplemental""; requests Annex I Parties to provide relevant information in relation to such domestic action; and provides that the facilitative branch of the Compliance Committee address questions of implementation on this issue. On nuclear, he suggested an addition to the language in the Pronk text giving an assessment role to the host country in terms of the sustainability of the project. On the Supervisory Committee, Minister Hodgson said the ""ball is in the court"" of the Russian Federation and Ukraine."
115	2001	enb12180e	['Switzerland']	The EU, also speaking for the CG-11 and SWITZERLAND, introduced a proposal on Article 6 (JI) containing appendices on standards for accreditation of independent entities and on criteria for baseline setting and monitoring, as well as several amendments to the draft decisions (FCCC/CP/2001/MISC.5).
77	2001	enb12184e	['Canada', 'Norway']	MECHANISMS: The negotiating group met in the morning to consider the draft COP decision as well as the remaining issues related to the Annex on modalities and procedures for the CDM. CANADA, the EU and NORWAY sought clarification on elections of alternate Executive Board members. NORWAY, opposed by SAMOA, suggested removing reference to election of alternate Board members. Co-Chair Chow referred the issue to informal consultations between concerned Parties. On registry requirements for the issuance of CERs into the pending accounts, Parties adopted draft text under the provision that they could revisit the matter after considering the draft decisions and text on Article 7.4 (assigned amounts).
78	2001	enb12184e	['Canada', 'Switzerland']	On the tasks of the Executive Board, SAMOA, SWITZERLAND, NEW ZEALAND and the EU highlighted the need for the Board to take into account information from Parties, accredited observers and stakeholders when reviewing CDM projects. CANADA called for time to consider the issue. On developing definitions and modalities for including afforestation and reforestation under the CDM, JAPAN and COLOMBIA noted insufficient focus on the terms of reference for their development. Delegates approved a proposal by the EU for a workshop prior to SBSTA-16 to develop the terms of reference and a work agenda, and for Parties to provide the Secretariat with submissions by 1 February 2002. On the inclusion of definitions and modalities in the Annex to the draft decision as it relates to LULUCF, JAPAN, with CANADA, COLOMBIA, AUSTRALIA and CHILE, proposed a number of references to the enhancement by sources and removals by sinks. The EU, BRAZIL, INDIA, CHINA and SAMOA noted that such modifications implied significant work at this late stage of the meeting and said it risked undermining or prejudging the work of SBSTA. After lengthy discussion, Co-Chair Estrada adopted the text without Japans proposed amendments. AUSTRALIA and JAPAN highlighted a lack of consensus on the matter, which Co-Chair Estrada said would be adequately reflected.
776	2001	enb12166e	['Russia', 'Canada', 'United States', 'United Kingdom']	Since the US announcement, the EU has sent diplomatic missions to several Parties, including Japan, Australia, Canada, the Russian Federation and Iran, in an effort to maintain support for the Protocol and its entry into force by 2002. In attempting to persuade the US to alter its position, the UK, some other EU countries and Japan have recently made attempts to demonstrate a willingness to compromise by leaving the door open for a possible amendment of the Protocol. One suggestion raised in early July by President Pronk and others is a possible two-year delay to the start of the first commitment period. The US has stated that it will participate at COP-6 Part II in negotiations on the Protocol in cases where talks might lead to outcomes affecting US trade, or if negotiations could set precedents for other international agreements. The US will be fully involved in all discussions relating to their commitments under the UNFCCC.
770	2001	enb12182e	['Russia']	On the section on reporting of supplementary information on mechanisms under Article 7.2 (national communications), the G-77/CHINA suggested an alternative paragraph specifying that the Party report a list and brief descriptions of projects under Articles 6 and 12, for which credits are held in registries during the reporting period. AUSTRALIA, with JAPAN, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and POLAND, supported not having a paragraph on mechanisms in this section. He explained that the information to be reported should be discussed in the context of Article 7.4 (modalities for the accounting of assigned amounts). Co-Chair Dovland suggested retaining the G-77/CHINA proposal in brackets and returning to it once work on the section on Article 7.4 was completed.
485	2001	enb12187e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'United States']	"On the current negotiations at COP-7, SWITZERLAND said it could not accept changes that weaken the Bonn Agreements, and stated that no country can shirk its responsibilities, especially if it is a major country in the ratification process. IRAN, for the G-77/ CHINA, underscored its approach of ""principled flexibility,"" and stated that neither COP-7 nor the WSSD was the appropriate forum for raising the issue of new commitments for developing countries. BELGIUM, for the EU, highlighted outstanding issues on the mechanisms requiring resolution, including the election of the Executive Board of the CDM. BULGARIA, for CG-11, CYPRUS and MALTA, noted the special circumstances of these individual countries in fulfilling their commitments. CANADA highlighted the need to be responsive to those whose participation is critical to entry into force of the Protocol. SWEDEN said success in Marrakesh would constitute a powerful pledge for the US to reconsider its decision to be part of a global coalition to combat climate change."
662	2001	enb12183e	['Canada', 'Norway']	On the role of the Executive Board in approving new methodologies and guidelines related to baselines, monitoring plans and project boundaries, CHINA, supported by BRAZIL and SAUDI ARABIA, proposed additional text suggesting the Board should review rather than approve new methodologies and guidelines, and should recommend these to the COP/MOP for approval. NORWAY, the EU and JAPAN disagreed. AUSTRALIA, supported by SAMOA, proposed a compromise text whereby the Executive Board would review and could make recommendations to the COP/MOP if it considered it necessary. In addition, the EU, opposed by CANADA and SAMOA, proposed the insertion of additionality to be considered under methodologies and guidelines. These matters were referred to ministers.
79	2001	enb12184e	['Norway', 'United States']	LDCS: The contact group met in the afternoon to report back on progress in the drafting groups on guidelines for the preparation of NAPAs and the establishment of the LDC expert group. Revised text on both matters has been prepared. Chair Gamede identified the two outstanding LDC issues: guidance to the LDC Fund; and status of implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.9 (LDCs). Parties then considered the guidance to an operating entity of the financial mechanism of the UNFCCC on the LDC Fund. MALI, for the LDCs, underscored a simplified operating procedure of the Fund enabling project approval within four months, and employment of local and regional expertise. The EU suggested that the legal and technical review had not taken into account the guidance document and, with the US, JAPAN, and NORWAY, said that developing guidance to the Fund should be considered at COP-8. UGANDA underscored the urgency of the LDCs concerns. Chair Gamede requested Parties to consider this informally, and to report back early Monday morning. If no agreement was reached, he said the matter of guidance to the Fund would be referred to ministers.
773	2001	enb12182e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	Delegates then considered a draft proposal by the LDC Group for a COP decision on the establishment of an LDC expert group, including an annex containing terms of reference for the group. A number of Annex I Parties raised concerns about the proposal, with the US and SWITZERLAND noting similar discussions taking place in the CGE group, and the EU suggesting that the groups might be combined at some point. Several LDCs highlighted the efficiency and value of an expert group in NAPA preparation and implementation. Delegates then discussed specific text in the proposed terms of reference on this expert groups mandate, with the EU, supported by other Annex I Parties, bracketing text relating to implementation of NAPAs.
116	2001	enb12180e	['Russia', 'Canada']	COMPLIANCE: Co-Chair Tuiloma Neroni Slade (Samoa) proposed working on the basis of a Co-Chairs non-paper on the status of negotiations highlighting editorial changes as well as initial agreement reached on text on the procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance. JAPAN, also on behalf CANADA, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and AUSTRALIA, put forward a proposal for a draft COP decision expressly deferring the issue of the nature of the consequences to COP/MOP-1. The G-77/CHINA and the EU said Ministers had agreed during COP-6 Part II that the consequences would be binding and that only the mode of adoption had been deferred to COP/MOP-1. The group then started consideration of the Co-Chairs non-paper, going through the sections on the preamble, the objective, the Compliance Committee, the plenary of the Committee and the facilitative branch. The Co-Chairs will hold consultations on disputed paragraphs.
772	2001	enb12182e	['Switzerland']	CGE: The informal contact group on the CGE met in morning and afternoon sessions. In the morning, Parties discussed whether to consider the revision of the terms of reference for the CGE or the guidelines for the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties first. At the end of the first meeting, it was agreed to begin with the terms of reference. Parties discussed language in this document referring to LDCs. Several LDCs noted that the CGE did not have a mandate to address the LDC NAPA process. The EU stressed linkages between the processes of preparing national communications and NAPAs. Text referring to LDCs was bracketed. On the composition of the CGE, the G-77/ CHINA requested removal of the expert from non-Annex I Parties in Europe proposed in the new terms of reference. The EU, SWITZERLAND and AUSTRALIA supported maintaining the current composition, and SWITZERLAND and AUSTRALIA suggested consideration of the terms of reference was therefore not necessary and could be withdrawn. Parties agreed to wait for the outcomes from the discussions in the informal group on LDCs before proceeding.
771	2001	enb12182e	['Russia', 'Canada']	"On decision-making, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION suggested a simple majority system. JAPAN, CANADA, POLAND and HUNGARY said the issue was linked to the outcome on the composition of the committee, and the issue was referred to ministers. Delegates then agreed to a proposal from CHINA reproducing a paragraph from the CDM text on the working language of the committee, the dissemination of its decisions, as well as the languages in which such decisions would be made available. The group also agreed to a proposal from SAMOA reproducing a paragraph from the CDM text on the open attendance of the committee meetings, with the addition that attendance also be open to ""accredited stakeholders."""
33	2001	enb12185e	['Canada']	"On the draft COP decision on principles, nature and scope of the mechanisms, CANADA and JAPAN, opposed by the EU, G-77/CHINA and SAMOA, proposed deleting text emphasizing that environmental integrity is to be achieved through sound modalities, rules and guidelines for the mechanisms, strict principles and rules governing LULUCF, and a strong compliance regime. After some discussion, the original text was retained, with reference to ""strict"" being replaced with ""sound and strong."" Consideration of the related draft COP/MOP decision continued in an afternoon session, with Co-Chair Chow suggesting deleting a paragraph specifying that the provisions on the use of mechanisms shall apply individually for Parties acting under Article 4 (joint fulfillment), on the understanding that in Bonn the flexibility on supplementarity was given to some countries in exchange of the deletion of text on Article 4. AUSTRALIA, CANADA and JAPAN opposed the deletion, arguing, inter alia, that broader issues of transparency and good governance were involved. The paragraph was referred to the ministers."
769	2001	enb12182e	['Canada']	Delegates then discussed matters relating to Protocol Article 4 (regional integration organization). The EU stated that specific reporting guidelines for regional integration organizations (RIOs) were not necessary. AOSIS, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, and CANADA stressed the need to ensure transparency and consistency between national inventories and that of the RIOs. The issue was set aside for further consideration.
47	2001	enb12181e	['Russia']	On the procedures for the enforcement branch, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, opposed by the EU, suggested text reflecting the right for the Party concerned to have a closed hearing. SAMOA expressed concern about upsetting the balance between access to information, transparency and public participation, and safeguarding the sovereign rights of the Party.
798	2001	enb12167e	['Norway', 'United States']	"On the funding of capacity building for disasters related to climate change, the EU, NORWAY and the US, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, expressed concern about overburdening the GEF. The US suggested deleting reference to the building of ""institutional capacity,"" while the EU proposed that capacity building not include the ""management"" of disasters. Co-Chair Ashe suggested that the GEF shall provide financial resources to build institutional capacity ""where appropriate"" and that the funding of the ""management"" of disasters be put in brackets. The text, as amended by Co-Chair Ashe, was set aside for discussion at a later date."
797	2001	enb12167e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'Norway']	Many delegates underscored the scale of credits available for sinks as a key issue for the first commitment period. AUSTRALIA and CANADA supported the Pronk text as a good starting point in this regard, stressing that LULUCF is fundamental for countries considering ratification. CANADA said it is working on a more country-specific proposal for moving forward on this issue. The EU highlighted scale as a problem but, with NORWAY and SWITZERLAND for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, stressed that the Pronk proposal represents a sound basis for negotiation.
796	2001	enb12167e	['Norway']	"On the organization of work, delegates agreed to establish four negotiating groups on the following issues: finance, technology transfer, adaptation, capacity building, and adverse effects, chaired by John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) and Andrej Kranjc (Slovenia); mechanisms, chaired by Raul Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina) and Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia); land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), chaired by Harald Dovland (Norway) and Philip Gwage (Uganda); and compliance, chaired by Tuiloma Neroni Slade (Samoa) and Harald Dovland. President Pronk noted that additional ""resource people"" delegates experienced on these specific questions would assist the chairs. He indicated that a further negotiating group may be established later on UNFCCC Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of information)."
791	2001	enb12173e	['Switzerland']	"POLICIES AND MEASURES: On ""best practices"" in policies and measures among Annex I Parties, Chair Dovland noted Party views submitted on a proposed workshops Terms of Reference (TOR), which will be determined at the current SBSTA session. SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, CG-11, the EU, AOSIS and others, requested that the issue be deferred, as a decision regarding the workshop had not been officially adopted at COP-6 Part I. Chair Dovland said he would consult with President Pronk and said informal consultations on the TOR would be facilitated by Switzerland and Tanzania."
486	2001	enb12187e	['Russia']	Delegates then discussed at length three options on the composition of the expert review teams (ERTs). Chair Dovland proposed adopting an option requesting the Secretariat to select ERT members with a view to achieving balance between experts from Annex I and non-Annex I Parties, without compromising skills requirements. This was supported by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, EU, JAPAN, and AUSTRALIA. The G-77/CHINA said he needed to consult further within the group, and no agreement was reached.
487	2001	enb12187e	['Canada', 'United States']	JAPAN said the issue of reporting on supplementarity relating to mechanisms should be forwarded to ministers for consideration. CHINA highlighted its proposed paragraph specifying the aim of reducing per capita emissions differences between developed and developing countries. The EU noted problems with such reporting, including lack of relevant developing country data. JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, CANADA and the US opposed the paragraph due to the lack of legal context.
46	2001	enb12181e	['Russia']	"On submissions, AUSTRALIA, supported by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and opposed by a number of Parties, suggested the deletion of the possibility for a Party to submit a question of implementation with respect to another Party, explaining that it had the potential to create rifts among Parties or could eventually be used for ""other reasons,"" and that the reports from expert review teams (ERTs) provided a thorough triggering process. The EU highlighted that the Party-to-Party triggering option was useful for the effectiveness and balance of the compliance procedures. With IRAN, he said that if questions could be indicated in the reports of ERTs, sovereign states should also have the possibility to make submissions against another Party. SAMOA stressed that procedures are non-adversarial, multilateral in nature and include due-process provisions. JAPAN, opposed by CHINA, suggested that triggering against another Party could be limited to the facilitative branch. Co-Chair Dovland said this issue was not of a drafting nature and would thus be forwarded to the Plenary."
223	2002	enb12202e	['Canada']	ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS: The Secretariat noted that 185 states and 1 regional organization have ratified the UNFCCC. He said Afghanistan had deposited its instrument of ratification on 19 September. On the provisional agenda (FCCC/ CP/2002/1, Add.1 and Add.2), the G-77/CHINA urged exclusion of Canadas proposal for a decision on modalities for the accounting of assigned amounts under Protocol Article 7.4 (registries) in relation to cleaner energy exports. The EU said this issue would be addressed by the SBI. He opposed Saudi Arabias request to include discussion on implementation of Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of P&Ms) on the agenda. SAUDI ARABIA said the issue was unfinished business from the BAPA and stressed preparation of a draft decision for COP/MOP-1. CANADA emphasized the cleaner energy proposal as a priority for the future success of the Protocol. The agenda was adopted with these items, and the issue of the second review of the adequacy of commitments, held in abeyance.
778	2002	enb12205e	['Norway', 'Switzerland', 'United States', 'Russia', 'Canada']	R&SO: Co-chaired by Sue Barrell (Australia) and S.K. Srivastav (India), the contact group met in three sessions on Saturday to discuss draft conclusions. CHINA, supported by JAPAN, INDIA, MALAYSIA and BOTSWANA, highlighted the importance of building endogenous capacity in developing countries. CANADA, with the EU and US, opposed text inviting the SBI to provide guidance to the financial mechanism in relation to decision 5/CP.5 (research and systematic observation) and 5/CP.7 (adverse effects). Delegates agreed on most remaining SBSTA conclusions in an evening session, failing to agree, however, on a sub-paragraph proposed by the Russian Federation referencing research priorities in support of the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC. The EU, NORWAY, SWITZERLAND, CHINA and AOSIS, opposed by the US, JAPAN and INDIA, supported retaining the sub-paragraph, amended to refer to exploring the scientific, technological and socioeconomic aspects needed to achieve the UNFCCCs ultimate objective.
398	2002	enb12206e	['Canada', 'Switzerland']	"FINANCIAL MECHANISM: SBI Chair Estrada convened the contact group in the morning. On the report of the GEF, INDIA, opposed by the EU, CANADA and SWITZERLAND, requested the deletion of text emphasizing the ""successful and substantial third GEF replenishment."" On behalf of the G-77/ CHINA, he proposed text stressing the effective operationalization of the recently established funds and the greater effectiveness of existing funds. Parties could not agree on the proposals."
351	2002	enb12201e	['Russia', 'Canada']	After protracted bilateral and multilateral talks, a package deal on LULUCF, mechanisms, Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8, and input to the WSSD was proposed on Thursday evening, 8 November. Although the deal was accepted by most regional groups, including the G-77/China and the EU, the Umbrella Group (a loose alliance of Annex I Parties that includes Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the Russian Federation) did not join the consensus. They disputed, among other things, eligibility requirements and bankability under the mechanisms. However, following extensive negotiations, the Marrakesh Accords were agreed, with key features including consideration of LULUCF Principles and limited banking of units generated by sinks under the CDM.
535	2002	enb12208e	['United States']	"On decision text adopting the improved guidelines, the EU, supported by the US and opposed by the G-77/CHINA, asked for text noting the need for review of the guidelines. JAPAN, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, preferred stating language that the guidelines ""shall be used"" instead of ""should be used"" to ensure the comparability of national communications. AUSTRALIA, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, proposed adding a procedural paragraph that would list work to be done. Chair Estrada said that there was no consensus on any of these proposals. The G-77/CHINA opposed a three-year time frame for completion of national communications after receipt of funding. Parties disagreed on,  inter alia, whether developing countries should use the guidelines ""to the extent that financial resources and their capacities allow."""
808	2002	enb12203e	['Albania', 'Moldova']	"Delegates to the Eighth Conference of the Parties (COP-8) to the UNFCCC met in three sessions of the SBI and two sessions of the SBSTA. The SBI addressed: Annex I national communications; the financial mechanism; capacity-building; a request from a group of countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus, Albania and the Republic of Moldova (CACAM) regarding their status under the UNFCCC; administrative and financial matters; a proposal by Croatia on land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF); and administrative and financial matters. The SBSTA considered: methodological issues; issues relating to hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs); research and systematic observation (R&SO); the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR); and ""good practices"" in policies and measures (P&Ms)."
350	2002	enb12201e	['United States']	"COP-6 PART II: In March 2001, the US administration repudiated the Protocol, stating that it considered the Protocol to be ""fatally flawed,"" as it would damage its economy and exempt developing countries from emission targets. Parties reconvened at COP-6 Part II and the fourteenth sessions of the subsidiary bodies, which met in Bonn, Germany, from 16-27 July 2001. After protracted consultations, President Pronk presented his proposal for a draft political decision. Several Parties announced that they could support the political decision, but disagreements surfaced over the nature of the compliance regime. After several days of consultations, ministers finally agreed to adopt the original political decision, with a revised section on compliance. The political decision or ""Bonn Agreements"" was formally adopted by the COP on 25 July 2001."
396	2002	enb12206e	['Albania']	The SBI met late at night to consider: Annex I national communications; capacity-building; implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects); the request from a group of countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus, Albania and Moldova (CACAM); arrangements for intergovernmental meetings; administrative and financial matters; the proposal by Croatia on land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF); and other matters.
397	2002	enb12206e	['United Kingdom']	Special circumstances of Croatia: On the special circumstances of Croatia under UNFCCC Article 4.6 (special circumstances of economies in transition), Jim Penman (UK) reported on informal consultations. SBSTA adopted draft conclusions which note that the procedure used by Croatia to estimate its base year emissions is neither consistent with IPCC Good Practice Guidance, nor with UNFCCC reporting guidelines (FCCC/SBSTA/ 2002/L.14).
56	2002	enb12207e	['Norway', 'Switzerland']	On future action, NEW ZEALAND called for a broad approach across countries. AOSIS and JAPAN said all countries will need to be involved in mitigation. Recognising that countries will carry different burdens with regard to mitigation, SWITZERLAND stressed cooperation and partnerships. NORWAY called for an ambitious and long-term global climate change regime and stressed the need for a political response to the IPCC TAR. POLAND said adaptation and funding for climate change must go hand-in-hand with mitigation and long-term strategies.
809	2002	enb12203e	['United States']	"LULUCF under the CDM: The FAO reported on a recent workshop on forest-related definitions that aimed to establish a framework for a new carbon terminology rather than to standardize definitions. MALAYSIA stressed ensuring the environmental integrity of CDM projects. BRAZIL supported developing ""a common language."" The US and EU supported the Colombian tonne-year accounting approach. Opposing Canadas SBSTA-16 proposal to change the baseline from 1989, the EU stressed its support for definitions set out in the Marrakesh Accords. COLOMBIA said the 1989 baseline could impede projects. JAPAN said that rules for sinks under the CDM should not be unnecessarily restrictive, and proposed that definitions and modalities should be agreed as a package at COP-9. SENEGAL, for the Africa Group, said definitions and modalities should be flexible and applicable to the local ecological context. She stressed links with combating poverty and desertification. TUVALU, for AOSIS, stressed the need for social and environmental project impact assessments. Chair Thorgeirsson said a contact group would be convened under Thelma Krug (Brazil) and Karsten Sach (Germany)."
780	2002	enb12205e	['Canada', 'Norway']	"LULUCF AND CDM: In a Saturday meeting of the contact group, Co-Chair Thelma Krug (Brazil) invited Parties to consider the definition of additionality as set out in the Marrakesh Accords. BRAZIL, for the G-77/CHINA, supported the EUs principles on additionality and said additionality should be considered on a project-by-project basis. The EU stressed the importance of ""true"" additionality. CANADA, with NORWAY, supported maintaining the existing definition of additionality. On leakage, the EU expressed concern about measuring leakage from activity displacement. The G-77/CHINA said that leakage had both positive and negative impacts. TUVALU and INDIA stressed the importance of impact assessments."
546	2002	enb12204e	['Canada']	The G-77/CHINA expressed concern about the lack of financial support for the implementation of the decision. Addressing the lack of funding for the workshops on insurance and risk assessment, she called for a mechanism to finance the workshops and proposed creating an expert group on adaptation. CANADA expressed interest in supporting the workshops. Several Parties stressed the importance of insurance related issues. SAMOA highlighted two reports indicating that nearly all losses in developing countries due to extreme events are not covered by insurance. JAPAN and others cautioned against holding too many workshops. IRAN stressed that the workshops should also address adaptation to the impact of response measures. Chair Estrada called on Daniela Stoytcheva (Bulgaria) and Enele Sopoaga (Tuvalu) to conduct informal consultations with Parties on the terms of reference for the workshops.
545	2002	enb12204e	['Russia', 'Canada', 'Switzerland', 'United States']	OTHER MATTERS: Cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy: CANADA introduced draft decision text supported by NEW ZEALAND, POLAND, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and SLOVENIA, and opposed by SAUDI ARABIA for the G-77/ CHINA, SWITZERLAND, and the US. The text requests the Secretariat to ask competent organizations to analyze the role of trade in cleaner energy in meeting the objective of the UNFCCC and the Protocol, and to report back to SBSTA-21. Several Parties reaffirmed their objection to Canadas original proposal on accounting for cleaner energy exports. The EU said that only generic issues relating to trade in cleaner energy should be discussed. Chair Thorgeirsson will undertake consultations on this issue.
779	2002	enb12205e	['Russia', 'Norway', 'Switzerland']	The group met Monday evening to consider revised draft conclusions, including new paragraphs. These highlighted key issues emerging from a special side event on research earlier in the day, which consisted of an exchange between SBSTA, the IPCC and several international research programmes. Following minor revisions, Parties agreed on key issues in the dialogue on research. On a new paragraph noting the need for a more coordinated research approach to address cross-cutting issues, INDIA, MALAYSIA and CHINA, opposed by the EU, RUSSIAN FEDERATION, NORWAY and SWITZERLAND, proposed deleting reference to the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations. Discussions continued into the night.
550	2002	enb12204e	['Canada', 'United States']	CGE: Chair Jos Romero said that new texts on improving the guidelines had been received from the EU and from AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN and the US. Parties agreed to delete several provisions in the chairs text in accordance with a G-77/China proposal.
529	2002	enb12208e	['United States']	"The US said that its climate approach is grounded in sound economic policy and noted its commitment to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of its economy by 18% over ten years. The US claimed that economic growth is the key to environmental progress. GERMANY responded by calling for ""absolute"" emissions reductions, noting that a failure to address climate change will result in economic harm."
530	2002	enb12208e	['Russia']	Regarding future actions, GERMANY said it would commit itself to a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2020 if all developed countries committed themselves to further reductions, and the EU committed itself to emission reductions of about 30%. SWEDEN, supported by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and BELGIUM, and opposed by OMAN and NIGERIA, called for a dialogue on developing country commitments. ARGENTINA said that Annex I countries have yet to take the lead on climate change. Co-Chair Moosa summarized the discussions and closed the session.
536	2002	enb12208e	['United States']	On decision text regarding new terms of reference for the Consultative Group of Experts on non-Annex I national communications (CGE), the EU called for the initiation of a process for the voluntary review of national communications. Chair Estrada noted that the review of national communications was a key difference between the processes of Annex I and non-Annex I national communications. Following a query from JAPAN on the funding for CGE meetings, the US said she was surprised to hear that funding came from the core budget, and that she could not agree to the text without further consultations. Chair Estrada said that he would take the text as it stood to the plenary for Parties to accept or reject.
781	2002	enb12205e	['Canada', 'Switzerland']	On Monday, Parties continued discussions on socioeconomic and environmental impacts. SWITZERLAND highlighted biodiversity concerns and promoted the inclusion of local stakeholders in decision-making. NEW ZEALAND drew attention to displacement and associated environmental risks from other types of CDM activities. TUVALU proposed developing a checklist of socioeconomic and environmental project criteria. Several Parties stressed that host countries should define such criteria. The EU said impact assessments should be considered in the modalities. The CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK expressed concern about sinks under the CDM. On uncertainties, CANADA, the EU and URUGUAY supported the provisions laid out in the Marrakesh Accords. TUVALU outlined three areas of uncertainty: measurement; additionality; and risk. URUGUAY noted the need to separate uncertainty from risk. INDIA noted the need to look beyond IPCC good practice guidance on LULUCF.
534	2002	enb12208e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	NON-ANNEX I ISSUES: This contact group, chaired by Jos Romero (Switzerland), met throughout the day. In the morning, delegates discussed the structure of the improved guidelines. In the afternoon, SBI Chair Estrada convened a high-level contact group and introduced a new draft of the guidelines. BRAZIL, for the G-77/CHINA, accepted the text as a basis for discussion. The EU, with AUSTRALIA, asked for additional time to consider the text. Chair Estrada suspended the meeting for informal consultations. Upon reconvening, Parties aired several concerns, which Chair Estrada said could not be integrated into the guidelines, but could be mentioned in his oral report to the COP. The US proposed moving a paragraph into the decision text that states that non-Annex I Parties can use elements from the guidelines for Annex I national communications on a voluntary basis.
784	2002	enb12205e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'United States', 'Norway']	On the review of the financial mechanism, SWITZERLAND called for this review to address the function and role of GEF, the accountability and quality control of GEF resources and an evaluation of enabling activities. NORWAY, supported by the US, SWITZERLAND, NORWAY, JAPAN, CANADA, AUSTRALIA and the EU, and opposed by INDIA, MALAYSIA, CHINA, called for the deletion of text initiating a process to aggregate GEF funding requirements for the UNFCCC, as well as a request to the Secretariat to produce a paper for SBI-18 outlining procedures for joint determination of necessary and available funding for UNFCCC implementation.
399	2002	enb12206e	['Norway', 'Switzerland', 'Canada']	On guidance to the Special Climate Change Fund, CANADA, SWITZERLAND, NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA, and JAPAN supported using a new text proposed by the EU as the basis for negotiations. INDIA, for the G-77/CHINA, preferred using the Chairs text. CANADA, with SWITZERLAND, stressed the prioritization of guidance to the Fund. NORWAY and the EU underscored their support for operationalizing the Fund, stressing the importance of identifying priorities and following similar procedures used in establishing the Least Developed Country (LDC) Fund. Parties could not agree on providing guidance on the Special Climate Change Fund to the financial mechanism for now, and agreed on an EU proposal to consider Party submissions and discussions at SB-18 and a decision at COP-9.
532	2002	enb12208e	['Iceland']	"On non-Annex I commitments, the G-77/CHINA opposed any text that would infer new commitments. VENEZUELA observed that action on technology transfer and finance by Annex I countries had been unsatisfactory and called on the COP to address compliance under the UNFCCC and the Marrakesh Accords. Claiming a right to development, CUBA opposed new commitments for developing countries. The EU underscored that mitigation has proven to be a powerful force for technological change and economic development. ICELAND addressed carbon intensities and the need to stimulate the development of technologies to avoid wasteful emissions. INDIA called for the provision of sufficient environmental ""space"" for developing countries to develop. THAILAND asked Parties to differentiate between luxury and survival emissions."
533	2002	enb12208e	['Norway']	AUSTRIA drew links between climate change and energy consumption patterns, renewable energy and natural resources. CHILE emphasized that national strategies for sustainable development must address adaptation and mitigation policies. CHAD stressed that the only legally valid instrument for reducing greenhouse gases is the Protocol and, with TANZANIA, SENEGAL, AUSTRIA, MALAWI, and NORWAY, called for ratification by all countries.
549	2002	enb12204e	['Russia', 'Canada', 'United States']	REPORT OF CDM EXECUTIVE BOARD: CDM Executive Board chair John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) introduced the Boards first report. He noted that it addresses, inter alia: the implementation of work plan tasks; financial and operational procedures; communication between the Board and stakeholders; and the draft rules of procedure. He identified issues requiring a COP decision, emphasizing the rules and modalities for small-scale CDM projects and the draft rules of procedure. He announced the resignation of a Board member from the Asia region. The EU said that further guidance on standards and procedures is necessary. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION supported small-scale projects. The US, with ARGENTINA, CHILE, COLOMBIA, and VENEZUELA, argued for transparent rules of procedure. ARGENTINA noted that some Parties hold unrealistic expectations about the CDM. AUSTRALIA and CANADA urged Parties to reach agreement on the rules. INDIA, with SRI LANKA, proposed developing country concessions for accreditation of operational entities.
225	2002	enb12202e	['United States']	Guidelines under Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8: On guidelines for the preparation of information required under Article 7 and for review under Article 8 and good practice guidance for Article 5.2 (adjustments), Chair Thorgeirsson highlighted outstanding issues to be addressed, including: options for the treatment of confidential data during review; training and capacity building for expert review teams; technical standards for data exchange between national registries, the CDM registry and the transaction log; and reporting and review of information on assigned amounts and national registries. The EU welcomed progress on options for the terms of service for lead reviewers and the training of experts. He supported a proposal on developing case studies on the calculation of adjustments under Article 5.2. The US stressed the importance of options for the treatment of confidential data and encouraged transparency of inventory data. SAUDI ARABIA said training of review experts should include developing country experts. Chair Thorgeirsson convened a contact group chaired by Helen Plume (New Zealand) and Festus Leboyera (South Africa).
349	2002	enb12201e	['Albania', 'Moldova']	"Other issues to be discussed include: cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy; the implementation of Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of P&Ms); special circumstances of Croatia under UNFCCC Article 4.6 (flexibility for countries with economies in transition); the Croatian proposal on forest management activities under Protocol Article 3.4 (additional activities); a Canadian proposal on modalities for the accounting of assigned amounts under Protocol Article 7.4 (registries) in relation to cleaner energy exports; the request from a group of countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus, Albania and the Republic of Moldova (CACAM) for the clarification of the term ""developing countries"" in the context of UNFCCC decisions; review of the adequacy of commitments under the UNFCCC; and a series of administrative and organizational matters."
783	2002	enb12205e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'Norway']	Delegates discussed the Least Developed Country (LDC) Fund without reaching agreement. CANADA noted that the chairs of the LDCs and the LDC Expert Group (LEG) were not present. He provided views on the draft decision to the GEF on the operation of the LDC Fund. Supported by NORWAY, the EU and SWITZERLAND, he stressed the importance of a clear focus on NAPAs and policy level, rather than operational level, guidance to the GEF.
531	2002	enb12208e	['Canada', 'Norway']	"ROUND TABLE III ""WRAP-UP:"" In the afternoon, COP President Baalu opened the third and final Round Table. Addressing the Delhi Declaration, ITALY said it should consider action beyond 2012. NORWAY called for a broader climate change regime. CANADA said it should consider, inter alia: ratification of the Protocol; recommendations of the IPCC TAR; efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and the UNFCCCs ultimate objectives. The COOK ISLANDS called for a World Climate Day. Stressing that the UNFCCC is not an energy convention, SAUDI ARABIA said that the Declaration should be a consensus document prioritizing adaptation to climate impacts and impacts of Annex I response measures."
227	2002	enb12202e	['United States']	TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER: Chair Thorgeirsson highlighted the annual Expert Group on Technology Transfers (EGTT) progress report and the report on the implementation of activities under decision 4/CP.7. He also noted the EGTTs new work programme annexed to the SBSTA-16 report. EGTT Chair Jukka Uosukainen (Finland) briefed Parties on the Groups meeting preceding COP-8. He said discussions had focused on technology needs assessment, technology information sharing, capacity building, enabling environments and financial support. He welcomed the newly elected EGTT Chair William Bonsu (Ghana) and vice-chair William Bradley (US). Belgium supported an EGTT workshop on enabling environments in 2003. G-77/CHINA said technology transfer to developing countries has been ineffective. He welcomed new initiatives such as the Climate Technology Initiative and urged assistance for both mitigation and adaptation. INDIA stressed that piecemeal approaches are unsatisfactory and supported consideration of access to resources, institutional capacity building, and business community participation.
782	2002	enb12205e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'United States', 'Norway']	FINANCIAL MECHANISM: SBI Chair Estrada convened this contact group on Monday evening. On the report of the GEF, the EU, supported by NORWAY, SWITZERLAND and the US, requested text highlighting the importance of the third GEF replenishment. Parties could not agree on a process to provide additional guidance to the financial mechanism for the operation of the Special Climate Change Fund. Instead of entering negotiations on the draft decision, NORWAY, SWITZERLAND, CANADA, JAPAN and the EU, opposed by INDIA, BRAZIL, BARBADOS and CHINA, requested the option to provide further submissions on the operational priorities of the Fund. CHINA, supported by INDIA, underscored the urgency of providing guidance in order to operationalize the Fund.
226	2002	enb12202e	['United Kingdom']	Special circumstances of Croatia under UNFCCC Article 4.6: CROATIA introduced a new technical paper. YUGOSLAVIA, opposed by the EU, said it could not support Croatias 1990 baseline proposal. Chair Thorgeirsson asked Jim Penman (UK) to convene an informal contact group.
810	2002	enb12203e	['Canada', 'United States']	Scientific and methodological aspects of the Brazilian proposal: The Secretariat highlighted a recent expert meeting. BRAZIL highlighted attribution of causes and consequences when assessing contributions to climate change. Opposed by SAUDI ARABIA and supported by MEXICO and the EU, he recommended renewing SBSTAs mandate on this issue. The US, CANADA and AUSTRALIA expressed concern about the lack of rigour of research on attribution. Consultations will be conducted by Murray Ward (New Zealand) and Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil).
537	2002	enb12208e	['Canada']	"Improvement of the guidelines for the preparation of non-Annex I national communications: Chair Estrada said the draft decision was not yet available. Noting that delegations had a number of suggestions, additions and proposals for the document, he said Parties had agreed to adopt the guidelines ""in a spirit of compromise."" The EU requested to see the decision. Chair Estrada suspended the meeting for 30 minutes. Upon reconvening, the EU repeated her request to see the text. CANADA stressed ""normal"" UN procedures by which documents are seen before they are adopted. Chair Estrada adjourned the meeting, saying the text would be ready for consideration Friday."
548	2002	enb12204e	['Canada', 'United States']	Arrangements for COP/MOP-1: The Secretariat presented a paper on the arrangements, proposing an integrated approach. The EU, CANADA, AUSTRALIA and JAPAN, opposed by SLOVENIA, supported one combined session for the sake of efficiency, noting some details need to be clarified. The US stressed the need to work on budgetary issues to ensure that its contributions are used to support the UNFCCC process. Chair Estrada said the Secretariat would prepare conclusions on this item.
547	2002	enb12204e	['Canada', 'United States']	ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS: Effective participation in the UNFCCC process: The Secretariat outlined options and proposals for the effective participation of observers in the UNFCCC and Protocol intersessional workshops and meetings of limited membership bodies. CANADA, with AUSTRALIA and the EU, advocated transparency while recognizing financial realities. The US supported participation through new approaches, including a constituency system.
811	2002	enb12203e	['United States']	IPCC TAR: Several Parties supported exploring ways to use information contained in the TAR. The EU, opposed by the US and MALAYSIA for G-77/CHINA, proposed an agenda item on the methodological issues relating to the stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions. Chair Thorgeirsson said he would prepare conclusions.
812	2002	enb12203e	['Canada', 'United States']	ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS: The EU requested the SBSTA to consider including reporting on P&Ms and proposed that the fourth national communications be submitted on 4 January, 2006, to coincide with the reporting process on demonstrable progress. CANADA, supported by the US, said that it would be premature to undertake major revisions to the guidelines. INDIA emphasized strengthening the reporting process for Annex I Parties. Chair Estrada said he would produce recommendations for the SBI based on consultations with delegates.
814	2002	enb12203e	['Canada', 'Switzerland']	ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS: The Secretariat presented its reports on administrative and financial matters. CANADA, supported by SWITZERLAND and BULGARIA, urged Parties to ensure early payment of contributions. He requested the Secretariat to provide its budget requirements for the activities relating to implementation of the Marrakesh Accords. Chair Estrada will draft conclusions on this issue.
815	2002	enb12203e	['Canada']	OTHER MATTERS: CROATIA noted the proposal for its forest cap and suggested that the issue be deferred pending the outcome of negotiations in the SBSTA. CANADA, opposed by the EU, supported the Croatian proposal and requested further information on the assessment of the forest cap.
228	2002	enb12202e	['Canada']	The EU said that LDC national adaptation programmes of action should be considered in national communications. The CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, with BANGLADESH and ERITREA, highlighted LDCs difficulties in developing national communications and called on SBSTA to address financial support. INDIA, supported by THAILAND and IRAN, noted that the improved guidelines should not exceed the UNFCCCs reporting requirements. CANADA, with the EU, highlighted the need for demand-driven financing. TUVALU drew attention to possible negative implications of tying adaptation finance to the completion of national communications. JAPAN called for the chairs text to reflect a balance between mitigation and adaptation reporting requirements.

Parties addressed text to be forwarded for consideration in the omnibus decision under the agenda item on additional guidance to the GEF, and agreed to consult informally on the paragraphs and submit views to the Secretariat. On timing of submissions of second and, where appropriate, third national communications, the US and SAINT LUCIA questioned the meaning of ""availability of financial resources."" The G-77/ CHINA noted that the preparation of national communications is a continuous process, but that the frequency of submissions is a ""non-issue."" Chair Sok Appadu requested submission of views from Parties for the preparation of a draft decision for discussion on Monday."
430	2003	enb12227e	['Canada', 'Norway']	"R&SO: On Saturday, Co-Chair Sue Barrell reported on informal consultations, noting divergent views on providing additional guidance to the GEF. She proposed compromise text, recalling the conclusions of SBSTA-17 and inviting the SBI, in considering additional guidance to the GEF, to give appropriate consideration to addressing the priority needs identified in regional action plans on global climate observing systems. Parties discussed under which fund the GEF would consider observation activities, and debated referring to SBI guidance to the ""financial mechanisms,"" ""financial mechanism"" or ""SCCF."" Stressing that this is for the SBI to decide, NORWAY, with AUSTRALIA, CANADA and the EU, supported a proposal by NEW ZEALAND to invite the SBI to give appropriate consideration to the issue in considering funding options. The G-77/CHINA objected to the proposal."
579	2003	enb12226e	['United States']	Parties also addressed holding a workshop for facilitating timely submission of fourth national communications. Opposed by the EU, the G-77/CHINA suggested removing reference to Article 4.2 throughout the draft decision, noting that this was judgmental. The US suggested this could address many of the concerns expressed in the group. Parties will continue deliberations in informal consultations on Monday, 8 December.
583	2003	enb12226e	['United Kingdom']	PROGRESS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION 5/ CP.7: Delegates in this contact group, co-chaired by Rob Mason (UK) and Al Waleed Al-Malik (United Arab Emirates), reviewed Parties perspectives on progress on the implementation of activities under decision 5/CP.7. Underlining the linkages of adaptation with other issues, the EU said decision 5/CP.7 enables important activities to be developed further. The G-77/CHINA said there is a need for substantive discussions on implementation of the decision, with a view to building on existing work. Noting that, in terms of the UNFCCC, adaptation is the priority, MICRONESIA, for AOSIS, stressed the vulnerability of SIDS and underlined, inter alia, the need for building capacity, addressing insurance challenges, and improving access to funding. SAUDI ARABIA underscored the need to take immediate action, support developing countries in the technical development of non-energy uses of fossil fuels, and exchange information on win-win P&Ms that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while minimizing adverse impacts on developing countries.

425	2003	enb12227e	['Canada']	SCCF: On Saturday, the Co-Chairs presented a revised draft COP decision. In preliminary comments, the G-77/CHINA addressed concerns that the text, inter alia, had not incorporated elements regarding the predictability, and new and additional nature of the funding, and had excluded references to technology transfer as it relates to adaptation. Noting that the text was a good basis for negotiations, the EU and CANADA said several elements had not been included in the revised text. Co-Chair Rawleston Moore then suspended the contact group to allow for informal consultations.
587	2003	enb12226e	['Russia', 'Canada']	GOOD PRACTICE GUIDANCE ON LULUCF: Delegates discussed draft conclusions, which, inter alia, recommend use of the IPCC Good Practice Guidance (GPG) under the UNFCCC and to consider them further at SBSTA-20 before recommending their use under the Protocol. TUVALU, for AOSIS, raised concern over adopting the GPG without sufficient time for its examination, and over the practicality of considering the GPG for the UNFCCC and Protocol separately. The IPCC explained how this is addressed in the GPG. The EU, JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND and CANADA urged adopting the guidelines for both the UNFCCC and the Protocol in order to prepare national inventories in time for entry into force of the Protocol. NEW ZEALAND, supported by AUSTRALIA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, emphasized the importance of adopting the GPG to advance the implementation of the UNFCCC, and the EU noted that delaying adoption of the GPG will prevent preparation of inventory submissions due in 2006. Opposed by TUVALU, the EU recommended recording Tuvalus concerns in the meetings minutes instead of amending the draft conclusions.
422	2003	enb12227e	['Norway', 'United States']	PROGRAMME BUDGET FOR 2004-5: On Saturday, Chair John Ashe presented a draft COP decision. SOUTH AFRICA expressed concern that measures to facilitate a prompt start to the CDM would be financed from voluntary funds. She requested a footnote, which states that several components would be funded from the core budget, while the remainder would come from the supplemental Trust Fund. NORWAY supported a 9% budget increase, while JAPAN reaffirmed its position to support a zero growth budget and to move the interim allocation from the core budget to the supplemental Trust Fund. The EU and NEW ZEALAND said Protocol development activities should remain in the core budget. Responding to a US suggestion to develop separate scales and budgets for the Protocol and UNFCCC, Chair Ashe proposed developing such an approach to be funded by Parties to the Protocol starting in January 2004.
584	2003	enb12226e	['United States']	R&SO: Parties considered a revised draft COP decision and draft conclusions. CHILE, the EU and US objected to referring to the importance of adhering to adopted principles of free and unrestricted exchange of information, noting that such principles do not exist. The G-77/CHINA said the Group would consult internally on this matter. Stressing the importance of sustained funding for regional action plans, the G-77/CHINA suggested that guidance on this issue should be given to the GEF. Referring to the SBSTA-17 conclusions containing a provision on this matter, Co-Chair Sue Barrell asked the G-77/CHINA whether it was necessary to include a request to the SBI to examine additional GEF guidance on this issue in the conclusions. The G-77/CHINA said it would hold internal consultations on the matter.
202	2003	enb12224e	['United States']	PROGRAMME BUDGET: Chair John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) emphasized the groups tasks of determining the budget level and addressing the Secretariats proposal for an interim funding allocation for the entry into force of the Protocol. On the options for the budget, the EU supported a 9% increase, while Japan supported zero nominal growth. Regarding the interim allocation, the EU said it regards this proposal as a positive attempt to give certainty and security to the financing of the Protocol, while JAPAN said these costs should be included in the Supplemental Trust Fund, not in the core budget. The US said Protocol-related developmental activities, particularly those related to the cooperative mechanims, should be shifted to the Supplemental Trust Fund or to the proposal for the interim allocation. AUSTRALIA urged that Protocol-related activities be funded by Parties to the Protocol only, and included in a separate budget and trust fund.
438	2003	enb12225e	['Belarus', 'Canada', 'United States', 'Russia']	REVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMITMENTS AND OF OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE UNFCCC: National communications from Annex I Parties: The EU and JAPAN reported on activities to reduce emissions and noted progress in meeting their Protocol targets. CANADA, AUSTRALIA and the US highlighted domestic measures. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION, BELARUS and SLOVENIA said the decline in emissions in their countries is due to the decoupling of GDP and emissions, and not due to economic decline. The G-77/ CHINA expressed concern over the increase in Annex I emissions and appealed for political commitment. ARGENTINA, opposed by the US, questioned the appropriateness of the emissions intensity measurement. SAUDI ARABIA, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, ALGERIA, and OMAN noted concern over the impact of response measures on developing countries.
424	2003	enb12227e	['United States']	On Monday, the G-77/CHINA suggested deleting text on recognizing that the submission of national communications would ensure that the COP has sufficient information to assess the UNFCCCs implementation in a timely manner. The EU proposed text that national communications assist the COP to review the UNFCCCs implementation. The G-77/CHINA objected, and said the Group would consult on this matter internally. The US proposed additional text that non-Annex I Parties should submit national greenhouse gas inventories every two years, with LDCs submitting their inventories with their national communications.
586	2003	enb12226e	['Canada', 'United States']	"METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES: Delegates reviewed the Co-Chairs draft conclusions. SAUDI ARABIA requested that a paragraph referring to the elements of future methodological work in an annex to the conclusions should be bracketed, until those elements are agreed. The US said cost implications must be noted. AUSTRALIA, opposed by UGANDA, said the data reported by Parties rather than the database should be referred to as the ""authoritative source."" AUSTRALIA introduced new text clarifying the role of a data-interface scoping phase, emphasizing that Parties should exchange views and consider a range of options. NEW ZEALAND, supported by CANADA, and opposed by the EU and JAPAN, suggested text noting that the conclusions complete the work under the agenda sub-item. CANADA recommended that text on capacity building and collaborative efforts be linked to the elements of methodological work. SAUDI ARABIA suggested deleting text on periodic overviews and stressed the need to focus on implementation. Discussions will continue in informal consultations on Saturday, 6 December."
578	2003	enb12226e	['United States']	ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS: This contact group, co-chaired by Jos Ovalle (Chile) and Michael Zammit-Cutajar (Malta), discussed a draft COP decision. ARGENTINA noted omissions in the draft decision regarding the scope of the issues, the extent of delay in submission of documents, problems in the implementation of P&Ms, and increasing emissions levels. He outlined problems of incompatible methods for making projections and of grouping together net and gross emissions. The US said references to commitments under the Protocol may be premature, questioned the interpretation of Article 4.2 (a) and (b) (fulfillment of commitments by developed country Parties) and objected to the focus on international aviation, noting that discussion of this issue should await the outcomes of SBSTAs discussions.
446	2003	enb12225e	['Canada', 'United States']	The EU, CANADA, and JAPAN, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA and the G-77/CHINA, supported the exchange of information on, inter alia, methods, models, and assumptions regarding projections. SAUDI ARABIA said win-win aspects of good practices in P&Ms in Annex I Parties and implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects) should be addressed. CANADA, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, said discussions on information, methods and tools for socioeconomic scenario-building should be included, while NEW ZEALAND suggested that the issue should be discussed with projections matters. The US and NEW ZEALAND, opposed by the EU, said the Co-Chairs proposal to include discussions on information exchange regarding methodologies for assessing mitigation and adaptation technologies overlaps with SBSTAs ongoing work.
426	2003	enb12227e	['Canada', 'United States']	"IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION 5/CP.7: On Monday, the G-77/CHINA, AUSTRALIA, US and EU expressed views on the Co-Chairs draft COP decision, with the G-77/CHINA noting that additions would be necessary, and the US urging that the text not be expanded further. Parties discussed the preambular paragraphs, debating whether to include text from decision 5/CP.7. The EU suggested text referring to meeting the requirements of sustainable development. Opposed by the G-77/CHINA, the US and CANADA said there is no need to emphasize specific aspects of decision 5/CP.7. Delegates then addressed how to qualify progress made on the implementation of decision 5/CP.7. Opposed by the G-77/CHINA, AUSTRALIA suggested welcoming ""significant"" progress in the implementation of 5/CP.7. Parties discussed the nature and timing of submissions on activities implemented to support the provisions of decision 5/CP.7. The G-77/CHINA suggested that submissions should contain information on support programmes to meet national needs and specific circumstances of developing country Parties arising from adverse effects of climate change. Parties discussed how to address views on insurance. The EU, supported by the US, suggested considering insurance and risk assessment, and removing reference to a work programme on insurance. In the evening, delegates addressed the remaining paragraphs in the draft decision in informal consultations."
444	2003	enb12225e	['Russia', 'Canada', 'Switzerland', 'Norway']	IPCC TAR: Chair Thorgeirsson introduced the draft decision and SBSTA conclusions on the IPCC TAR. Noting the need to further discuss the themes and issues to be considered by SBSTA under the two new agenda items, the G-77/CHINA objected to forwarding the draft decision to the COP. Opposing the G-77/ China, AUSTRALIA, the EU, SWITZERLAND, NORWAY, RUSSIAN FEDERATION and JAPAN emphasized the need to begin work on the new agenda items, and noted the importance for the COP to consider them. The EU said that work on substance can be initiated, while further considering specific themes and issues. CANADA emphasized the need to avoid duplication of work, and to ensure a Party-driven process. The EU highlighted that work under the new agenda items will contribute to meeting the UNFCCCs ultimate objective.
441	2003	enb12225e	['United States']	Submission of second, and where appropriate, third national communications: The EU emphasized the importance of an efficient process for the preparation of non-Annex I national communications. The US said that non-Annex I national communications should be submitted no more than four years after the submission of their initial communications. In the case of communications from LDCs, she said these should be submitted every five years. Regarding the submission of greenhouse gas inventories, she proposed that non-Annex I Parties should submit these every two years, and that LDCs should submit inventories every five years as part of their national communications. Chair Stoycheva requested non-Annex I national communications contact group Chair Sok Appadu to also consider this sub-item and prepare a draft COP decision.
443	2003	enb12225e	['Canada', 'Norway']	SCCF: Co-Chairs Rawleston Moore and Frode Neergaard presented the Co-Chairs draft COP decision for consideration. NIGERIA, for the G-77/China, said the decision could not be used as the basis of negotiation, emphasizing that it did not contain sufficient guidance on operational procedures, including a review process, and that it lacked reference to the additionality of the funds. He requested the Co-Chairs to prepare a new draft decision and adjourn the meeting to allow the G-77/China time to consult internally. While noting minor concerns over the draft decision, the EU, CANADA and NORWAY said the draft decision provides a good basis for negotiations. Following a break for informal consultations by the G-77/China, the Co-Chairs adjourned the meeting.
793	2003	enb12229e	['Canada', 'United States']	IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION 5/CP.7: Following informal consultations on the draft conclusions late Tuesday night, delegates agreed to invite Parties and relevant international organizations to report on activities to meet the needs of developing countries arising from the adverse effects of climate change. Changing its earlier support, SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by the G-77/ CHINA, MICRONESIA, US, EU, NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN and CANADA, proposed adding bracketed text on reporting on actions to address the adverse affects of response measures. Following informal consultations, the group agreed to the draft conclusions, without amendment, and to include Saudi Arabias proposal in the draft negotiating text included in the annex to the draft conclusions.
658	2003	enb12223e	['Montenegro', 'Serbia', 'Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'United Kingdom']	OTHER MATTERS: Proposal by Croatia on LULUCF and special circumstances of Croatia: CROATIA stressed the importance of resolving the issue of its special circumstances under UNFCCC Article 4.6 (special circumstances of EITs) and called for the continuation of informal negotiations on the issue. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA and SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO said that the Croatian emissions estimates and projections are based on emissions not originating in Croatias territory. CROATIA pointed to new emissions estimates and projections that do not include emissions from neighboring countries, noting that the concerns of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro are no longer relevant. Chair Stoycheva said Jim Penman (UK) would undertake informal consultations.
582	2003	enb12226e	['Canada', 'Norway']	SCCF: The G-77/CHINA introduced the Groups views on the Co-Chairs draft decision, noting, inter alia, that the SCCF should be financed from new and additional funds, and that the funding level of the SCCF should match that of the GEFs climate change focal area. Delegates then undertook a paragraph-by-paragraph reading of the text. The EU, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, said the objective of the SCCF is to assist developing countries to integrate climate change factors into national sustainable development and poverty reduction strategies, and their implementation. Opposed by the G-77/CHINA, he urged that the SCCFs function is to support mainstreaming of climate change factors in development activities at national and local levels. The G-77/CHINA, opposed by the EU and NORWAY, stressed the need for predictable and adequate funding levels. On the inclusion of activities in decision 7/CP.7 (funding under the UNFCCC), particularly on economic diversification, the EU, with NORWAY, opposed by the G-77/ CHINA, called for the deletion of the reference. Sharing the same concern, CANADA proposed discussing a process to further elaborate these items following the operationalization of the SCCF.
442	2003	enb12225e	['United States', 'United Kingdom']	Progress on the implementation of activities under decision 5/CP.7: The EU, US and AUSTRALIA noted activities that have taken place to implement decision 5/CP.7, including workshops and the third GEF replenishment, and welcomed an exchange of views on this issue during COP-9. Chair Stoycheva said that Rob Mason (UK) and Al Waleed Al-Malik (United Arab Emirates) would co-chair a contact group to prepare a draft COP decision on the matter.
580	2003	enb12226e	['United States']	"Parties deliberated whether the preparation of national communications has provided a ""valuable opportunity"" for capacity building, with the G-77/CHINA urging deletion of this reference. Opposed by the G-77/CHINA, JAPAN preferred removing reference to ""further"" financial and technical support for enhancing national capacities. Regarding a compilation and synthesis of information from national communications from small island developing States (SIDS) with a focus on adaptation and mitigation, NIUE and ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA, supported by the US, AUSTRALIA, and EU, urged retaining this as a separate synthesis document."
200	2003	enb12224e	['United States']	NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS: Delegates heard a presentation by CGE Chair Brian Challenger (Antigua and Barbuda) on the proposed work programme of the CGE for 2003-7. Participants discussed the distribution of regional experts within each of the thematic groups of the CGE, and funding for workshops. The US, supported by the EU, suggested that workshops be organized based on status of preparation of communications, rather than on regions. Draft conclusions were distributed for discussion at the next contact group meeting.
447	2003	enb12225e	['Canada', 'United States']	Recommending a focus beyond trade issues, CANADA, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA and the EU, suggested that discussions on cleaner or less-greenhouse gas-emitting energy should be included. NEW ZEALAND, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, said discussions on methodologies on the impact of implementation of the Protocol should be included under the projections topic. The EU, opposed by JAPAN, the US, CANADA, CHINA, and NEW ZEALAND, urged discussions on methodologies to determine Parties contributions.
439	2003	enb12225e	['Switzerland']	REPORT OF THE CDM EB: CDM EB Chair Hans Jrgen Stehr presented a report on the activities of the EB. He noted that nine proposals have been approved, and stressed the importance of sustaining funding for activities of the EB. The G-77/CHINA highlighted the need for equitable geographic distribution of designated operational entities (DOE) and financial and technical assistance to promote the emergence of such entities in developing countries. With GHANA, he underscored the importance of the sustainable development objectives of CDM projects. SWITZERLAND supported the continuation of creative proposals and ideas for approaching the EBs tasks. JAPAN and the EU called for accelerated project registration. ARGENTINA expressed concern at the lengthy process for evaluating methodologies.
445	2003	enb12225e	['Canada']	GOOD PRACTICE GUIDANCE ON LULUCF:  Co-Chair Audun Rosland reported progress on the common reporting format and announced that the EU, with the help of Canada, would present reporting tables on sectoral background data for LULUCF based on IPCC Good Practice Guidance (GPG). On harvested wood products, delegates discussed the Co-Chairs draft conclusions, which invite submissions from Parties by 15 April 2004 in order to review the matter at SBSTA-21. Text remains bracketed on the reference to taking the GPG into consideration when making submissions.
427	2003	enb12227e	['Canada', 'United States']	"TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER: On Saturday, Parties reviewed the Co-Chairs draft conclusions. GHANA and THAILAND recommended amending text on support from international and other organizations. The US suggested text noting the need to take account of the financial resources that ""may be needed"" for the implementation of the EGTTs work programme, while THAILAND and GHANA supported text stating that the EGTT ""requires"" more resources. CANADA expressed concern about prejudging financial needs. CHINA and MALAYSIA recommended combining paragraphs on resource allocation and requests for support to the EGTT. The G-77/CHINA introduced text on enhancing: the ""push factor"" in developed countries to transfer technologies to developing countries; assessments on technology transfer; and joint research on environmentally sound technologies. The EU suggested text on reporting on capacity-building activities relating to technology transfer in national communications. Deliberations continued in informal discussions."
428	2003	enb12227e	['Russia', 'Canada']	GOOD PRACTICE GUIDANCE ON LULUCF: On Saturday, delegates discussed revised draft conclusions and a draft COP decision. TUVALU raised concern over recommending the IPCC Good Practice Guidance (GPG) without having had time for its full consideration. Opposing this, the EU, with JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA, CANADA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION urged adopting the GPG for both the UNFCCC and the Protocol in order to prepare national inventories in time for implementation.
429	2003	enb12227e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'United States']	Delegates discussed revised text on factoring out direct human-induced changes in carbon stocks from indirect and natural effects. The G-77/CHINA proposed referring to the IPCC statement to SBSTA when taking note of the IPCC report on factoring out. The US, SWITZERLAND and NEW ZEALAND objected to this proposal. Regarding the need to address accounting of LULUCF activities, CANADA, supported by NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA and JAPAN, proposed referring to the IPCC report. Opposing this proposal, the G-77/CHINA suggested referring to text in a draft COP/MOP decision contained in decision 11/CP.7 (LULUCF) on changes in stocks from natural effects. On Parties submissions, the EU and AUSTRALIA, opposed by NEW ZEALAND and TUVALU, suggested inviting submissions on issues relating to LULUCF, other than on factoring out.
199	2003	enb12224e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'United States']	R&SO: This group was co-chaired by Sue Barrell (Australia) and Philip Gwage (Uganda). Parties discussed a draft decision and draft conclusions on global observing systems for climate. Co-Chair Barrell outlined the GCOS Cooperation Mechanism, which identifies the most effective use of existing resources for improving global observing systems of climate in developing countries. INDIA, supported by the G-77/CHINA, suggested including reference to the WMO principles for free data exchange, while the US cautioned against referring to principles established under any one specific organization. MALI, for the G-77/China, noted the need for guidance to the GEF regarding sustaining infrastructure. He also stressed the importance of implementing regional action plans. The EU, supported by SWITZERLAND, encouraged digitalizing historical data. CANADA suggested inviting the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) to prioritize work on climate monitoring, and the US proposed requesting GCOS and GEO to coordinate their work. CHILE stressed the need to call on national governments to provide financial resources to national meteorological authorities.
581	2003	enb12226e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	On guidance to the GEF, CROATIA proposed a request to the GEF that its approach to enhancing capacity building should respond to the framework for capacity building in EITs. SWITZERLAND, AUSTRALIA and the US proposed forwarding text on further guidance to the GEF for consideration under the relevant agenda item. The G-77/CHINA and EU objected, noting the importance of capacity-building experts agreeing on the text first. Due to lack of time, Parties agreed to forward the bracketed text for consideration under the agenda item on further guidance to the GEF.
98	2004	enb12258e	['Canada', 'United States']	Discussion: QATAR said the pressing needs of developing countries should be met through full implementation of commitments by Annex I Parties, including on capacity building, technology transfer and financial support. GERMANY emphasized that to prevent an increase in temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius, emissions must be halved by 2050, and a binding medium-term goal to reduce emissions by 2020 should be discussed. He urged the US to reduce its emissions to 1990 levels according to its UNFCCC commitment and said the decoupling of GDP and greenhouse-gas emissions growth in developing countries must be achieved. Noting that the future of the planet is at stake, LUXEMBOURG stressed the urgent need to halt the growth of global emissions within two decades. BRAZIL supported discussing future actions and a negotiating mandate for 2012, while respecting the historical responsibilities of developed and developing countries. IRELAND, FRANCE, SWEDEN and MICRONESIA supported a prompt, comprehensive and open dialogue on the future of the climate change process. Announcing that his country will soon ratify the Protocol, PAKISTAN recommended engaging non-Parties and maintaining a regime architecture that is sufficiently flexible and open to allow late entrants. CANADA stressed the importance of multilateral action.
59	2004	enb12252e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	CDM EB: The contact group, chaired by Raúl Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina), reviewed a draft decision and heard general remarks. The US proposed an amendment to Rule 27 of the EB Rules of Procedure on attendance at meetings, stating that “attendance means physical presence in the room in which the EB meets.” Chair Estrada-Oyuela noted that this type of amendment has budgetary implications and requires guidance from the contact group on the financial mechanism. JAPAN emphasized the need to prioritize energy projects and, with the EU, the need for transparency. The EU and SWITZERLAND noted the importance of addressing the implications of CDM activities for the achievement of objectives of other multilateral environmental agreements. JAPAN said he would provide text on proposals for new baseline and monitoring methodologies for types of project activities in sectors not yet covered by approved methodologies.
389	2004	enb12256e	['Russia', 'Canada', 'United States']	LULUCF: Eugene Hendrick (Ireland) reported on the informal drafting group on HWP. He proposed new text inviting Parties, inter alia, to: submit data and information on HWP if they have not done so already, and provide updated information on experience with the IPCC 1996 Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidelines and the GPG Appendix on the HWP methodological issues, by 1 August 2005. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION cautioned that the HWP methodology should not be addressed prior to the completion of the GPG, as inconsistencies could arise. He also proposed deletion of reference to the GPG Appendix. BRAZIL, for the G-77/China, proposed that submitting data and information on HWP should explicitly apply to Annex I Parties. The US, with CANADA and the EU, proposed that non-Annex I Parties should also be allowed to submit information if they wish to do so. The G-77/CHINA requested time to consult on the issue internally. Following informal discussions, delegates agreed to refer only to Annex I Parties.
663	2004	enb12251e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	FINANCIAL MECHANISM: Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF): The EU said a recent meeting of potential SCCF donors had resulted in pledges of US$35 million. SAUDI ARABIA said no single activity should be prioritized over others. ARGENTINA, with PANAMA, welcomed the pledges to the SCCF, but noted that these are insufficient for effectively supporting adaptation and disaster response. AOSIS, supported by the AFRICA GROUP, LDCs, NAMIBIA, CUBA and UGANDA, expressed concern over the interpretation of COP guidance by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), underlining that the most vulnerable countries face difficulty in accessing GEF funds due to the burden of co-financing requirements, the existence of additional criteria and indicators not adopted by the COP, and the narrow scope of adaptation projects eligible under the GEF. SWITZERLAND noted that the new criteria seek to simplify the incremental cost principle and the US welcomed the differentiation in criteria applied to the General Trust Fund and SCCF. SAMOA urged that more innovative approaches be used and that the COP, not the GEF, should determine eligibility criteria.
63	2004	enb12252e	['Canada', 'United States']	DISCUSSION: AUSTRALIA and JAPAN stressed the importance of fostering multilateral cooperation on mitigation initiatives. CANADA expressed optimism at the varied mitigation efforts ongoing globally. The US highlighted the importance of partnerships and proposed that SBSTA address policy tools for clean coal production and energy efficiency. The INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY (IEA) said effective mitigation requires a portfolio of technologies and effective policy frameworks. He noted that the IEA is hosting more than 40 implementing agreements on technology development. The EU, with the COOK ISLANDS, said barriers to the uptake of small-scale renewable energy need to be addressed further.
58	2004	enb12252e	['Canada', 'United States']	ADAPTATION: JAMAICA, for the G-77/China, said the SBSTA in-session workshop held on 8 December highlighted the urgency for action to address adaptation. AUSTRALIA stressed the importance of adaptation for both developed and developing countries. The EU recommended reviewing the outcomes of the SBSTA-20 and SBSTA-21 workshops to identify impacts of different levels and rates of climate change, and options for adaptation. The US said that individual extreme weather events cannot be linked to climate change. SUDAN, for the Africa Group, and ARGENTINA said adaptation is a global priority. JAPAN said both mitigation and adaptation should be addressed at the global level. CANADA called for strengthening the adaptation knowledge-base. On ways to build adaptive capacity, NICARAGUA pointed to participatory processes that include local communities and technical experts, and CHINA urged mobilization of funds and technology transfer from developed countries.
60	2004	enb12252e	['Russia']	The EU and ARGENTINA said adaptation should be included in sustainable development plans. JAPAN and the EU stressed the need to balance adaptation and mitigation, while INDIA said focus should be on adaptation. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION called for enhanced coordination with the Convention on Biological Diversity, Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification with regard to adaptation. TANZANIA stressed the need to identify areas where immediate action is required.
57	2004	enb12252e	['Canada']	OTHER MATTERS: Implementation of Protocol Article 2.3: Chair Benrageb urged Parties to move forward on this issue. SAUDI ARABIA expressed disappointment about the lack of progress on Article 2.3 since COP-8. The EU, CANADA and JAPAN stated that Article 2.3 is sufficiently reflected in decision 5/CP.7. Chair Benrageb will consult informally on the issue.
664	2004	enb12251e	['United States']	Implementation of decision 5/CP.8 (review of the financial mechanism): JAPAN welcomed the GEF’s leverage of substantial co-financing resources. The US noted that the GEF finances the incremental costs of implementation, yet many projects presented in national communications do not identify such costs. The EU highlighted the importance of identifying funds for the fourth GEF replenishment.
387	2004	enb12256e	['Canada', 'United States']	ADVERSE EFFECTS: Parties reviewed text in a Co-Chairs’ non-paper focusing on the impacts of the implementation of response measures. The EU, US and AUSTRALIA questioned the need for “forums” on insurance for adverse effects of response measures and on economic diversification prior to such adverse effects becoming apparent, but stated that a one-off event on modeling may be of value. The G-77/CHINA said events on insurance, modeling and economic diversification should take place in the form of expert groups. The US, supported by CANADA and the EU, said text on mobilizing resources for implementation should mirror language in decision 5/CP.7. SAUDI ARABIA supported the language in the non-paper, emphasizing the need for action on this issue. Discussions continued informally.
103	2004	enb12259e	['Norway', 'Ukraine']	Discussion: UKRAINE and OMAN noted their recent ratifications of the Protocol. EGYPT stressed the need for greater efforts on adaptation and technology transfer. NORWAY underlined the need for a strong political response coming out of COP-10. ROMANIA supported the integration of adaptation and mitigation measures. JAPAN noted a paradigm shift in the awareness of its citizens, following recent extreme weather events in Japan. He said that Japan is engaging in “proactive” action for adaptation. TANZANIA said adaptation to climate change is an equity issue, noting the disproportionate impacts of climate change on LDCs.
62	2004	enb12252e	['United States']	ADVERSE EFFECTS: Co-Chairs Paul Watkinson and Samuel Adejuwon reviewed an amendment from the EU and a draft decision text proposed by the G-77/China. The US, supported by several others, requested time to analyze the new texts. The Co-Chairs will prepare a consolidated text and the group will reconvene informally.
61	2004	enb12252e	['Canada']	LDCS: This group was co-chaired by Bubu Jallow (the Gambia) and Ricardo Moita (Portugal). Delegates discussed guidance to the GEF on the LDC Fund and the LDC Expert Group (LEG). CANADA commended the LEG’s work, and TANZANIA, for the LDCs, proposed extending the LEG’s mandate to support the implementation of national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs). On guidance to the GEF, LDCs, SAMOA and MALAWI expressed concern over co-financing requirements, noting that decision 6/CP.9 (guidance on the operation of the LDC Fund) provides for full funding of NAPAs. The GEF said that, since decision 6/CP.9 requires the GEF to develop criteria for full funding, some activities would qualify for full funding, while others would build on existing development projects and require co-financing from other sources, or in-kind contributions by recipient governments. The EU said co-financing emphasizes countries’ sense of ownership over projects.
104	2004	enb12259e	['Norway', 'Iceland']	SOUTH AFRICA called for sustained financial support for developing countries to implement adaptation plans and, with INDONESIA, said these should be integrated into development plans. ICELAND, NORWAY and FINLAND pointed to the Arctic assessment of climate change, which shows that the Arctic climate is warming rapidly. FINLAND highlighted the need to make all actors aware of climate risks to enable them to prepare for the consequences of climate change. MICRONESIA said the eligibility criteria for adaptation funds should be streamlined. BRAZIL stressed the importance of developing scientific and technical cooperation and creating a network of research centers on adaptation in developing countries. INDONESIA said adaptation funding should include research.
95	2004	enb12255e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'Norway']	LULUCF: Co-Chair Audun Rosland presented new draft conclusions on GPG and other issues relating to LULUCF. AUSTRALIA, with the EU, NEW ZEALAND, NORWAY, JAPAN and SWITZERLAND supported the text, while AOSIS and other Parties expressed reservations on several matters, including a proposed open-ended dialogue. Co-Chair Rosland said the text is intended as a compromise between Parties. On HWP, Parties are unresolved on how the IPCC should develop methods to estimate, measure and report on HWP in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Inventories. CANADA stated that the IPCC should develop methodologies in a “neutral” fashion in relation to potential accounting approaches for HWP. AUSTRALIA recommended that the IPCC’s work on HWP should be consistent with definitions under the UNFCCC. AOSIS said that Parties should avoid presuming what the IPCC is intending to do in its work. Other outstanding issues will be taken up by informal drafting groups.
97	2004	enb12255e	['Norway', 'United States']	Discussion: The US suggested that the length of the appointment period for COP Presidents could be extended. He pointed to the uneven balance of having both ministers, who know little about the UNFCCC, and senior officials, who are well aware of the issues, at high-level segments. INDIA said regular high-level segments are important to demonstrate political commitment, but suggested reviewing the effectiveness of the recent high-level panels and round-table discussions. NORWAY said the presence of ministers helps raise public awareness of climate change issues. The NETHERLANDS supported annual COPs and ministerials, and noted that workshops are helpful, but can be improved. CHINA said that some delegations have sufficient autonomy to make decisions without the presence of ministers.
665	2004	enb12251e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	UNFCCC ARTICLE 6: UNEP reported on its contributions to assist Parties in their implementation of Article 6. The EU and SWITZERLAND highlighted the merit of an information clearing house. The US said the clearing house should be user-friendly, cost-effective and developed through a phased approach. Crispin d’Auvergne (Saint Lucia) will chair a contact group on the issue.
391	2004	enb12256e	['Canada', 'United States']	CHINA said policies and frameworks are not technological issues, while the EU argued that they are related to barriers and deployment. On renewable energy, CANADA, with the G-77/CHINA and SAUDI ARABIA, argued that no specific technology should be promoted. SAUDI ARABIA reminded Parties that the UNFCCC is not an energy convention. The US stressed the need to focus on practical opportunities and solutions. Agreement could not be reached, and discussions continued informally into the night.
392	2004	enb12256e	['United States']	The US commended the Argentine proposal but preferred to postpone making a decision until discussions on the implementation of decision 5/CP.7 conclude, to prevent overlaps. PERU considered implementation of decision 5/CP.7 a prerequisite for the type of assessment outlined in the Argentine proposal. AUSTRALIA, supported by the EU, noted that the proposal establishes a framework for a programme of work, and that the programme itself and its detailed activities could be adopted at a later stage. Discussions continued into the night.
390	2004	enb12256e	['Canada', 'United States', 'Norway']	MITIGATION: Co-Chair Toshiyuki Sakamoto introduced a draft decision based on informal consultations. The G-77/CHINA reiterated that socioeconomic aspects and technological cooperation should be given greater emphasis in the text. AUSTRALIA noted that discussions should not be limited to bilateral activities, but should include multilateral and international activities. Regarding themes for a future SBSTA in-session workshop on mitigation, Parties discussed whether the workshop proposal should specifically mention renewable energy and efficiency, or regulatory policies and frameworks. SAUDI ARABIA reiterated the need to focus on existing technologies and, opposed by AUSTRALIA, CANADA, US, CHILE, NEW ZEALAND and JAPAN, pointed to the necessity to address the spillover effects of mitigation. He said land-use changes and non-CO2 gases should also be addressed. The EU, supported by the US, proposed addressing co-benefits. Opposed by AUSTRALIA, CANADA, US, CHILE, NEW ZEALAND and JAPAN, the EU, with NORWAY, proposed focusing on energy efficiency and renewables, as well as policy and regulatory frameworks. The US said that he did not object to renewable energy, but would prefer no reference to it in the text.
86	2004	enb12250e	['Switzerland']	The EU suggested that discussions on LDCs should take into account deliberations on decision 5/CP.7, in order to avoid duplication. Opposed by UGANDA, SWITZERLAND proposed conducting a compilation and synthesis of the first NAPAs. AOSIS urged the implementation of NAPAs immediately following their completion. Bubu Jallow (the Gambia) and Ricardo Moita (Portugal) will co-chair a contact group on this issue.
99	2004	enb12258e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ON UNFCCC ACTIVITIES RELEVANT TO OTHER INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS: Thiscontact group was chaired by José Romero (Switzerland). Delegates discussed possible input to the relevant intergovernmental processes. The US, opposed by AOSIS, said conclusions should only state that an exchange of views occurred and, with SAUDI ARABIA and INDIA, said reporting by the Secretariat must only be on activities on which there is consensus among the Parties. The EU, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, said: COP-11 should be updated on the outcomes of the events in question; the COP should be noted as a resource body for the Commission on Sustainable Development discussions on energy and climate change; and that the conclusions should refer to a miscellaneous document refl ecting the EU’s intervention in Plenary. AOSIS, supported by the EU, and opposed by the US, JAPAN and SAUDI ARABIA, proposed draft text that includes views of Parties given in Plenary. The US, SAUDI ARABIA and INDIA cautioned against negotiating the outcomes of processes before they begin.
87	2004	enb12250e	['Montenegro', 'Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'Serbia']	OTHER MATTERS: Level of emissions for the base year of Croatia: The Secretariat explained that Croatia’s greenhouse gas inventory was reviewed in September 2004. CROATIA, supported by the EU, expressed hope that the issue of Croatia's level of 1990 emissions will be resolved at COP-10. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA noted acceptance of the review fi ndings. SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO expressed reservations concerning the report, and requested further consideration of the issue during COP-10. Jim Penman will facilitate informal consultations on the matter.
105	2004	enb12259e	['Canada', 'United States']	CANADA said adaptation to climate change is a global problem that requires resolute international initiatives. The US said the US Country Studies Program was one of the first to carry out vulnerability assessments, and FRANCE noted efforts to undertake vulnerability assessments of French coastal zones. SRI LANKA recalled that poverty eradication is the main challenge, and called for adaptation funding to be equitably distributed. BARBADOS, for AOSIS, called for further implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action.
393	2004	enb12256e	['Canada', 'United States']	TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER: The contact group, co-chaired by Kishan Kumarsingh and Holger Liptow, met in the evening. Tentative agreement on the draft conclusions’ paragraph on fossil fuels was reached informally earlier in the day, paving the way for further discussion on a draft decision. The Co-Chairs introduced a revised text on a draft decision. Issues related to networking between the UNFCCC’s technology clearing house (TT:CLEAR) and technology information centers were agreed. Discussions then focused on: the Expert Group on Technology Transfer's (EGTT) framework for enhancing implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.5 (technology transfer); terms of reference for this framework; and the review of EGTT as mandated by decision 4/CP.7 (development and transfer of technologies). The G-77/CHINA, opposed by the US, EU, CANADA and AUSTRALIA, proposed to include reference to the implementation of the framework.
388	2004	enb12256e	['Canada']	PROTOCOL ARTICLE 7.4: Delegates considered a revised draft decision on issues relating to registry systems that had resulted from informal consultations, and worked through the text paragraph-by-paragraph, focusing on paragraphs where previous changes had been made. CANADA preferred to reflect that groups other than Parties are also developing registries, and that appropriate ways to exchange technical information with administrators of similar types of registry systems should be explored. Regarding the test plan and schedules for the initialization of the electronic communications with registry systems, the EU preferred this to be carried out prior to COP/MOP-1 in order to ensure the prompt start of the CDM. CHINA expressed concern about the verification of the tests.
94	2004	enb12255e	['United States']	TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER: Following informal consultations, Co-Chairs Holger Liptow and Kishan Kumarsingh presented revised draft conclusions, which delegates discussed paragraph-by-paragraph. Consensus was reached on all text except for one paragraph on fossil-fuel technologies, as it addresses articles other than UNFCCC Article 4.5 (technology transfer). SAUDI ARABIA proposed to bracket the draft conclusions in their entirety until the paragraph is addressed. The Co-Chairs noted that the paragraph had been forwarded to COP President González García for consultations. The Co-Chairs also introduced a draft decision based on text presented by the G-77/China. The EU, AUSTRALIA, and other Parties stated that the draft decision could not be discussed until consensus on the draft conclusions is reached. The US said that some Parties are holding the process “hostage.” Informal consultations on how to proceed will be held.
84	2004	enb12250e	['Canada', 'United Kingdom']	Small-scale A&R CDM: The Secretariat presented a proposal for a draft decision on modalities and procedures for small-scale A&R CDM, and on measures to facilitate their implementation. SENEGAL stressed the need to guarantee benefits to low income communities. JAPAN, supported by CANADA, said simplified modalities and procedures are necessary to reduce transaction costs, and the EU said simplified modalities and procedures should avoid overestimating carbon credits or compromising the Protocol’s environmental integrity. URUGUAY stressed the importance of synergies with other conventions. A contact group will be co-chaired by Thelma Krug (Brazil) and Jim Penman (UK).
96	2004	enb12255e	['Norway', 'United States']	Discussion: NORWAY, with DENMARK, supported less frequent consideration of agenda items that do not require action at each session. CHINA said prioritization of agenda items should be based on technical, and not political, criteria. INDIA said the intersessional period could be used more effectively, and proposed that session documents be made available earlier on the Secretariat’s website. The NETHERLANDS stressed, inter alia, the need for: fi xed criteria and time-frames for COP and COP/MOP work; a multi-year work programme; and issue clustering. SAUDI ARABIA said the current frequency of COPs should be maintained and that there should not be time limits on issues in abeyance. DENMARK noted that mandates of contact groups are often too focused, leaving chairs unable to trade off or balance issues. SOUTH AFRICA said negotiators have become too focused and have lost track of what the UNFCCC is about, making big issues out of small technicalities. The US supported multi-year work programmes, new mechanisms for clustering issues, and a greater focus on scientifi c issues in SBSTA. JAPAN suggested deadlines on items in abeyance and stated that COPs should be held annually to maintain public interest.
667	2004	enb12251e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS: Representatives from the IPCC, Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), Food and Agriculture Organization, and UN Forum on Forests reported on their respective activities related to the UNFCCC process. SWITZERLAND suggested strengthening the role of the Joint Liaison Group of the CBD, UNFCCC and UN Convention to Combat Desertifi cation. The US said cooperation should be on national and local levels. A contact group, co-chaired by Outi Berghäll (Finland) and Marcela Main (Chile) will address the issue.
137	2004	enb12254e	['Canada', 'United States']	FINANCIAL MECHANISM: Co-Chair Rawleston Moore distributed a draft decision text on the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF). Delegates addressed funding needs for developing countries to meet their commitments under the UNFCCC in the context of decision 5/CP.8 (review of the financial mechanism). SOUTH AFRICA, for the G-77/China, said that, in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding between the GEF and the COP, the COP and GEF should jointly determine the necessary funding. The US, CANADA, EU and JAPAN supported maintaining the existing modalities for identifying funding. On the process for the review of the financial mechanism, the EU, CANADA, JAPAN and US said that existing guidelines should be used. The G-77/CHINA requested time for further consultations. Co-Chair Moore invited Parties to hold informal consultations on these issues.
179	2004	enb12253e	['Canada']	LDCS: This group was co-chaired by Bubu Jallow (the Gambia) and Ricardo Moita (Portugal). Delegates discussed guidance to the GEF on the LDC Fund and the LDC Expert Group (LEG). CANADA commended the LEG’s work, and TANZANIA, for the LDCs, proposed extending the LEG’s mandate to support the implementation of national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs). On guidance to the GEF, LDCs, SAMOA and MALAWI expressed concern over co-financing requirements, noting that decision 6/CP.9 (guidance on the operation of the LDC Fund) provides for full funding of NAPAs. The GEF said that, since decision 6/CP.9 requires the GEF to develop criteria for full funding, some activities would qualify for full funding, while others would build on existing development projects and require co-financing from other sources, or in-kind contributions by recipient governments. The EU said co-financing emphasizes countries’ sense of ownership over projects.
178	2004	enb12253e	['Russia']	The EU and ARGENTINA said adaptation should be included in sustainable development plans. JAPAN and the EU stressed the need to balance adaptation and mitigation, while INDIA said focus should be on adaptation. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION called for enhanced coordination with the Convention on Biological Diversity, Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification with regard to adaptation. TANZANIA stressed the need to identify areas where immediate action is required.
176	2004	enb12253e	['Canada', 'United States']	ADAPTATION: JAMAICA, for the G-77/China, said the SBSTA in-session workshop held on 8 December highlighted the urgency for action to address adaptation. AUSTRALIA stressed the importance of adaptation for both developed and developing countries. The EU recommended reviewing the outcomes of the SBSTA-20 and SBSTA-21 workshops to identify impacts of different levels and rates of climate change, and options for adaptation. The US said that individual extreme weather events cannot be linked to climate change. SUDAN, for the Africa Group, and ARGENTINA said adaptation is a global priority. JAPAN said both mitigation and adaptation should be addressed at the global level. CANADA called for strengthening the adaptation knowledge-base. On ways to build adaptive capacity, NICARAGUA pointed to participatory processes that include local communities and technical experts, and CHINA urged mobilization of funds and technology transfer from developed countries.
175	2004	enb12253e	['Canada']	OTHER MATTERS: Implementation of Protocol Article 2.3: Chair Benrageb urged Parties to move forward on this issue. SAUDI ARABIA expressed disappointment about the lack of progress on Article 2.3 since COP-8. The EU, CANADA and JAPAN stated that Article 2.3 is sufficiently reflected in decision 5/CP.7. Chair Benrageb will consult informally on the issue.
832	2004	enb12257e	['Montenegro', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Serbia']	OTHER MATTERS: Level of emissions for the base year of Croatia: Jim Penman (UK) reported on informal consultations, noting that text could not be agreed. The US and CROATIA, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA and SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO, suggested that further consultations be held. Parties adopted the draft conclusions with an amendment that SBI will continue its consideration of this issue at its next session (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.21).
108	2004	enb12259e	['Turkey']	NEPAL stressed the need for accessible, low-cost technology. The CZECH REPUBLIC outlined his country’s national climate change strategy, which aims to reduce emissions by 25% by 2020. TURKEY outlined actions in his country to reduce emissions and raise awareness of climate change. BOLIVIA called for CDM forestry projects that involve low-income communities. KUWAIT and EGYPT announced their imminent ratifi cations of the Protocol.
136	2004	enb12254e	['Canada', 'United States']	CAPACITY BUILDING: Co-Chair Roger Cornforth requested views from delegates on a proposal submitted by the G-77/China to serve as a basis for negotiations on the draft decision on capacity building. The EU, with JAPAN, US, AUSTRALIA and CANADA, stated that they could not accept the text, which he said does not correspond to the agreed terms of reference. JAPAN stressed that the review of the capacity-building frameworks should address neither future activities nor guidance to the GEF. The G-77/CHINA emphasized that the proposed text represents the view of over 100 developing countries that are affected by the decision. The EU, supported by the US, CANADA and JAPAN, and opposed by the G-77/CHINA, proposed that the Co-Chairs prepare a new draft decision text. Co-Chair Cornforth invited new proposals for the draft decision from other Parties. Discussions continued informally on capacity building in countries with economies in transition.
107	2004	enb12259e	['Iceland']	Discussion: JAPAN said the CDM promotes technology transfer and that institutional arrangements are necessary to develop the CDM further. QATAR called for environmentally sound technologies for developing countries. BANGLADESH and TUNISIA noted efforts to move away from carbon-intensive development paths. AUSTRIA said that most climate-friendly technologies are not competitive. The CONGO urged Parties to consider its forests as a global carbon sink. NEPAL said capacity building is a priority in the long-term. ICELAND emphasized the need to increase international cooperation to disseminate clean technologies. DENMARK highlighted the role of the State in promoting clean technologies. EGYPT said that technology transfer should be promoted through joint ventures.
138	2004	enb12254e	['Canada', 'United States']	CDM EB: Delegates discussed the draft decision text on the CDM EB. Regarding the implications of CDM project activities for achieving objectives of other environmental agreements, the EU suggested highlighting in particular the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. BRAZIL, opposed by the US, expressed concern about the costs of facilitating the physical presence of observers at EB meetings. INDIA recommended preambular text on the definition of “additionality.” JAPAN, opposed by CANADA and BRAZIL, suggested text restraining the EB from holding closed sessions, and text requesting the EB to develop guidance on, inter alia, methodologies for energy efficiency and for transport sector CDM projects. INDIA suggested text on an EB database of approved methodologies and text on procedures for the amendment of approved methodologies on the basis of experience gained. He also proposed noting that the use of “tools for the demonstration and assessment of additionality” is not mandatory for project participants, and, opposed by the EU, recommended text noting, inter alia, that a number of Parties have expressed concern about the status of the tools. The EU recommended text requesting the EB to intensify its efforts to facilitate efficient and transparent decisions by the EB and its panels.
831	2004	enb12257e	['United States']	MITIGATION: The EU reiterated preference to request the Secretariat to compile submissions from Parties on lessons learned from mitigation workshops held to date and future steps under this agenda item, to facilitate ongoing consideration of this agenda item “and elements of a future work programme” at SBSTA-23. The G-77/CHINA, with the US and others, opposed reference to a future work programme. Delegates agreed to forward the bracketed text to SBSTA.
110	2004	enb12259e	['United States']	EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ON UNFCCC ACTIVITIES RELEVANT TO OTHER INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS: On reporting the activities of the ten-year review of the Barbados Programme of Action (BPOA+10), the World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR) and CSD processes to the UNFCCC, the US suggested only reporting to SBSTA-23 and only on CSD activities. SAUDI ARABIA said there should be no reporting to the UNFCCC whatsoever. AOSIS and the EU insisted on keeping provisions on reporting on the relevant processes to COP-11 and referring to the submissions of Parties regarding activities relevant to these processes contained in UNFCCC miscellaneous documents. Following discussion throughout the afternoon and evening, Parties agreed on text with deletion of references to miscellaneous documents, and including text on reporting to SBSTA on the CSD and BPOA+10 activities.
666	2004	enb12251e	['United States']	METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES: Greenhouse gas inventories: The IPCC Inventories Task Force Bureau reported on progress in compiling the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Inventories. AUSTRALIA, with the EU and US, called for further development of the UNFCCC website. Branca Americano (Brazil) and Helen Plume (New Zealand) will facilitate informal consultations on the issue.
109	2004	enb12259e	['Canada', 'United States']	KUWAIT welcomed discussions on the second commitment period, and said these should be guided by Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of policies and measures) and 3.14 (minimization of adverse effects). PORTUGAL said his country is already implementing ambitious policies, including carbon taxation measures. CANADA announced its “One-Tonne Challenge,” a social marketing campaign for citizens to reduce their emissions. ALGERIA stressed the importance of decoupling economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions, and looking beyond the fi rst commitment period. LIBYA highlighted its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. TUNISIA and the US outlined national actions to address climate change.
80	2004	enb12250e	['Turkey']	The NETHERLANDS, for the EU, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, expressed continued commitment to addressing climate change and highlighted the launch of the EU emissions trading scheme in January 2005. He supported limiting global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius, noting that a greater increase would result in irreversible damages. TUVALU, for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), highlighted the need for strong linkages with the 10-year review of the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States (BPOA+10) and the World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR), and emphasized the importance of dialogue on adaptation.
139	2004	enb12254e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'Norway']	LDCS: This contact group discussed matters relating to LDCs. Noting that the mandate of the LDC Expert Group (LEG) runs through 2005, the EU proposed discussing the LEG’s work and the extension of its mandate at COP-11. TANZANIA, on behalf of LDCs, agreed, suggesting that the LEG provide guidance on implementation of national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs). On guidance to the GEF on the LDC Fund, LDCs reaffirmed their support for the principle of full-cost funding, and emphasized the urgency of adaptation activities. He highlighted difficulties with the sliding scale proposed by the GEF for co-financing project activities, and suggested discussing a threshold for full financing. JAPAN opposed discussing levels of funding until NAPAs are completed and projects are identified. SWITZERLAND, the EU, NORWAY and CANADA supported the GEFï¿½s co-financing requirements, saying that projects should not stand in a vacuum and, since national policies will generally address the most urgent activities, LDC Fund projects should complement and build on these efforts. The Co-Chairs will prepare a draft decision for consideration.
140	2004	enb12254e	['Russia', 'Canada', 'United States', 'Norway']	On HWP, BRAZIL, with many others, welcomed the IPCC’s work on HWP and noted that HWP could be better discussed after completion of the IPCC Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Inventories in 2006. The EU, with NORWAY, and opposed by CANADA, requested that SBSTA seek submissions by Parties on specifi c national HWP data by 1 August 2005. AUSTRALIA cautioned Parties that inventory reporting should not be altered, stating that inventories should remain “pure” and not be linked to political discussions. The US urged Parties to report on HWP in a transparent manner. CHINA said double accounting remains germane and the IPCC should address this matter. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said the IPCC should consider all categories of emissions and removals from HWP for future accounting. Co-Chair Agyemang-Bonsu will prepare new text on factoring out and HWP.
180	2004	enb12253e	['United States']	ADVERSE EFFECTS: Co-Chairs Paul Watkinson and Samuel Adejuwon reviewed an amendment from the EU and a draft decision text proposed by the G-77/China. The US, supported by several others, requested time to analyze the new texts. The Co-Chairs will prepare a consolidated text and the group will reconvene informally.
181	2004	enb12253e	['Canada', 'United States']	DISCUSSION: AUSTRALIA and JAPAN stressed the importance of fostering multilateral cooperation on mitigation initiatives. CANADA expressed optimism at the varied mitigation efforts ongoing globally. The US highlighted the importance of partnerships and proposed that SBSTA address policy tools for clean coal production and energy efficiency. The INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY (IEA) said effective mitigation requires a portfolio of technologies and effective policy frameworks. He noted that the IEA is hosting more than 40 implementing agreements on technology development. The EU, with the COOK ISLANDS, said barriers to the uptake of small-scale renewable energy need to be addressed further.
177	2004	enb12253e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	CDM EB: The contact group, chaired by Raúl Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina), reviewed a draft decision and heard general remarks. The US proposed an amendment to Rule 27 of the EB Rules of Procedure on attendance at meetings, stating that “attendance means physical presence in the room in which the EB meets.” Chair Estrada-Oyuela noted that this type of amendment has budgetary implications and requires guidance from the contact group on the financial mechanism. JAPAN emphasized the need to prioritize energy projects and, with the EU, the need for transparency. The EU and SWITZERLAND noted the importance of addressing the implications of CDM activities for the achievement of objectives of other multilateral environmental agreements. JAPAN said he would provide text on proposals for new baseline and monitoring methodologies for types of project activities in sectors not yet covered by approved methodologies.
83	2004	enb12250e	['Canada', 'United States', 'Norway']	METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES: Good practice guidance for LULUCF: AUSTRALIA, supported by the EU, US, JAPAN and CANADA, looked forward to continued discussions on harvested wood products (HWP). AOSIS said that reporting and accounting for HWP should be driven by good science and not by market incentives. AUSTRALIA, supported by CANADA and JAPAN, tabled a written proposal for an open-ended policy dialogue on LULUCF and the EU recommended that SBSTA hold a LULUCF workshop in 2005. CANADA, supported by JAPAN, EU and NORWAY, urged the adoption of the good practice guidance at COP-10. William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana) and Audun Rosland (Norway) will co-chair a contact group on the issue.
85	2004	enb12250e	['Switzerland']	R&SO: The Secretariat presented the “Implementation plan for the global observing system for climate in support of the UNFCCC,” and the Global Climate Observing System presented its activity report. SWITZERLAND proposed that the IPCC take note of SBSTA conclusions on these matters and consider them in its Fourth Assessment Report. Stefan Rösner (Germany) and Soobaraj Nayroo Sok Appadu (Mauritius) will co-chair a contact group on this issue.
669	2004	enb12251e	['Canada', 'United Kingdom']	SMALL-SCALE A&R CDM: Thelma Krug (Brazil) and Jim Penman (UK) co-chaired this contact group. Delegates discussed the proposal for a draft decision on simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale A&R CDM activities and measures to facilitate the implementation of project activities, paragraph-by-paragraph. On definitions of small-scale A&R CDM, JAPAN, with several Parties, and opposed by AOSIS, supported reference to average projected net anthropogenic greenhouse gas removals by sinks. AOSIS, opposed by CHILE, JAPAN, and PERU, proposed deletion of text stating that projects will be exempt from, or subject to, paying a lower share of proceeds to the Protocolï¿½s Adaptation Fund. CANADA, with several Parties, and opposed by the EU and AOSIS, supported maintaining reference to reduced rates of the share of project proceeds to cover administrative expenses, noting that costs are the greatest barrier for low income communities. Participants agreed to delete text encouraging host Parties to establish measures to facilitate implementation of small-scale A&R. Text inviting assistance for capacity-building activities for the application and implementation of simplified modalities and procedures was agreed.
82	2004	enb12250e	['United States']	The US, supported by SAUDI ARABIA and opposed by ARGENTINA, AOSIS, the EU and MAURITIUS, disputed discussion on inputs from the COP to the BPOA+10 and WCDR. Following informal discussions, Parties agreed to consider an “exchange of views on UNFCCC activities relevant to other intergovernmental meetings,” with a footnote in the agenda stating that the exchange of views will be reflected in the COP-10 report and serve to assist the Executive Secretary in reporting to these meetings. Parties adopted the agenda, with Article 2.3 and the review of Article 4.2(a) and (b) (Annex I commitments) held in abeyance.
81	2004	enb12250e	['Canada']	President González García then introduced the provisional agenda for adoption. CANADA withdrew its proposal on cleaner energy exports, in the spirit of moving discussions forward. The EU, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, proposed deleting the agenda item on matters relating to Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of policies and measures).
668	2004	enb12251e	['Canada', 'Norway']	"LULUCF GPG: This contact group was co-chaired by Audun Rosland (Norway) and William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana). Co-Chair Rosland recalled progress achieved on the common reporting format at SBSTA-20. Delegates heard presentations from Canada and Sweden on reporting systems for the Protocol and engaged in a question-and-answer session. The Secretariat reported on issues related to LULUCF under Protocol Article 6 (joint implementation). Co-Chair Rosland, supported by the EU, CANADA and JAPAN, proposed removing all brackets in the draft negotiating text forwarded from SBSTA-20 and deleting the option on the common reporting format referring to Article 6. BRAZIL, for G-77/China, requested time to consider the matter further, but hoped to reach agreement on the issue at COP-10. AOSIS, opposed by CANADA and NEW ZEALAND, said SBSTA should request the IPCC to revise ""method one"" (units of land subject to multiple activities) in the GPG."
106	2004	enb12259e	['Kazakhstan']	OMAN and QATAR underscored the importance of implementing UNFCCC Article 4.8 (adverse effects) with respect to response measures. KIRIBATI and FIJI stressed that adaptation measures should respond only to the adverse impacts of climate change, and not to the adverse impacts of mitigation measures. FIJI urged the international community to be sympathetic to the needs of SIDS. GABON highlighted the importance of Central African forests in global carbon sequestration and emphasized the need to streamline the funding process. KAZAKHSTAN said his country is ready to undertake voluntary commitments for greenhouse gas emissions reductions. MALTA said the costs of climate change impacts should be widely recognized and supported an open-ended dialogue.
92	2005	enb12281e	['United States']	ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS: Options for the Review Process: Vitaly Matsarski, UNFCCC Secretariat, introduced a proposal for streamlining review processes (FCCC/SBI/2005/16). The EU and JAPAN supported the proposal, while the US expressed concern about eliminating in-country in-depth reviews. Emily Ojoo-Massawa (Kenya) and Dimitrios Lalas (Greece) will co-chair a contact group.
594	2005	enb12284e	['United States']	ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS: Delegates reviewed a draft COP decision and offered initial comments on a draft COP/MOP decision. On the COP decision, they agreed to a US proposal to note the need to streamline the review procedures in light of the additional review requirements for Annex I Parties that are also Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. Delegates also agreed to text requesting the Secretariat to organize a “centralized” rather than “expedited” review of the fourth national communications. The group then discussed an EU proposal, opposed by the US, to add reference to the year 2007 when noting that annual inventory reviews for 2006 may be delayed in order to facilitate coordination with other review processes. The Co-Chairs will produce a revised draft COP decision for consideration at the next contact group meeting, at which time delegates will also review the draft COP/MOP decision.
596	2005	enb12284e	['Russia', 'Canada']	The EU, supported by CANADA, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and others, emphasized that JI should start immediately and that lessons from the CDM should be used as much as possible, including accreditation of DOEs for JI. China, for the G-77/CHINA, noted differences between CDM and JI, cautioning that DOEs and CDM methodologies should not be applied automatically. Chair Stoycheva said she would prepare a draft decision by Friday.
636	2005	enb12288e	['Norway', 'Switzerland']	Emissions from Fuel Used for International Aviation and Maritime Transport: José Romero (Switzerland) reported to SBSTA that no consensus had been reached in consultations. The EU and NORWAY, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, requested more time to negotiate. Informal consultations resumed, but bracketed text remained (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/CRP.1). In plenary, the EU, SOUTH AFRICA, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, CHILE, AOSIS and others supported deleting brackets and approving the document, while SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT and LIBYA opposed the text. CHINA and ALGERIA supported Chair Benrageb’s proposal to postpone the issue until SBSTA 24. No agreement was reached and SBSTA instead adopted brief conclusions forwarding the matter to SBSTA 24 (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.28).
90	2005	enb12281e	['United States']	SBSTA Chair Abdullatif Benrageb (Libya) opened the session and introduced the provisional agenda. The US, opposed by AOSIS, the EU and G-77/CHINA, requested removing agenda item 11(a) relating to small island developing States (SIDS). The US also asked for clarification on inclusion of item 10 (IPCC special report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage). The agenda was provisionally adopted pending informal consultations on these issues. Since Libya is not yet a Party to the Kyoto Protocol, SBSTA Vice-Chair Amjad Abdulla (Maldives) was invited to chair SBSTA for Protocol-related agenda items.
89	2005	enb12281e	['United Kingdom']	Late Monday morning, President Dion declared the COP/MOP open. Regarding the provisional agenda, the UK, for the EU, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, objected to the inclusion of agenda item 10 on Article 2.3 (response measures) on the grounds that it is addressed elsewhere. However, the agenda was adopted as presented.
88	2005	enb12281e	['United Kingdom']	OPENING STATEMENTS: Several speakers highlighted technology transfer and the five year programme of work on adaptation.

The US said such a workshop should focus on experiences. NORWAY, the EU and G-77/CHINA noted that consideration of ocean storage is premature. AOSIS expressed concern regarding the risks involved in carbon dioxide capture and storage, and LIBYA said more research was needed. AUSTRALIA, with the G-77/CHINA, stressed the need for demonstration projects in both developed and developing countries. IRAN asked for inclusion of such projects in the CDM, while CHINA said ï¿½the door should be left openï¿½ for this. Co-Chairs Agyemang-Bonsu and Verheye will consult informally.
407	2005	enb12280e	['United States', 'United Kingdom']	G8 MEETING AND MINISTERIAL DIALOGUE: On 8 July 2005, leaders attending the G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, agreed to a communiqué recognizing humanity’s serious impact on climate change and making a commitment to promote innovation, energy efficiency, conservation and cleaner technologies. Participants also agreed to proceed with a “Dialogue on Climate Change, Clean Energy and Sustainable Development.” The first ministerial dialogue was held in London, UK, on 1 November 2005. It was attended by energy and environment ministers from 20 countries, who focused on energy technologies and steps to achieve a low-carbon economy. According to some reports, the focus on technological solutions and private sector involvement reflected recent efforts by the EU, US and other large economies to find common ground in spite of differences over the binding targets set out under the Kyoto Protocol. The London dialogue followed an informal ministerial meeting in Greenland in mid-August designed to discuss policy differences among several key countries.
635	2005	enb12288e	['Switzerland']	Guidance to the GEF:  Delegates continued discussions in a contact group, considering a revised draft decision that would apply the current MOU between the COP and the GEF to the COP/MOP and GEF. South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA, said there was no need for an MOU given that the existing MOU covers the Convention. JAPAN, the EU, and SWITZERLAND said the MOU was needed and supported the draft. SBI Chair Becker reported to plenary on lack of agreement, and the item was forwarded to SBI 24 for further consideration.
416	2005	enb12290e	['Armenia']	Flexible Mechanisms: Highlighting the need to improve the CDM’s administration and streamline the procedures, IRAN welcomed the draft decision on national programmes under the CDM. ECUADOR emphasized that the CDM is a compliance instrument that must ensure environmental integrity of carbon credits. BURKINA FASO said the CDM should be implemented in a way that brings equity to small countries. SWEDEN highlighted the catalytic role of the mechanisms and the EU emissions trading scheme. SENEGAL and MADAGASCAR emphasized the need for equitable regional distribution of CDM projects, with RWANDA calling for increased participation of African countries in mitigation projects. CAMBODIA emphasized the CDM’s role in promoting sustainable development. URUGUAY said appropriate CDM indicators should enable all countries to participate in CDM projects. ARMENIA proposed allowing developing countries who accept voluntary emissions reductions to participate in all flexible mechanisms after 2012. ARMENIA and ARGENTINA noted the need for longer-term certainty in the CDM. BULGARIA highlighted the Green Investment Scheme as an opportunity for economies in transition to trade Assigned Amount Units while ensuring the Protocol’s environmental integrity.
418	2005	enb12290e	['Israel']	Synergies and Cooperation: The CZECH REPUBLIC called for solidarity in combating climate change. GREECE said agreements reached here should assure the continuation of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and assist those that feel the effects of climate change. ISRAEL said political differences should not impede countries from engaging in a global effort to protect the environment. ALGERIA and TUNISIA highlighted the links between desertification and climate change. ANGOLA said climate change and implementation of the Kyoto Protocol should be resolved in a global political framework for poverty alleviation.
460	2005	enb12285e	['United States']	Other Matters: Delegates also engaged in a preliminary discussion on a proposal from the G-77/China that would request more information from the GEF on the RAF and ask the Secretariat to examine and report on the conformity of the RAF with the COP-GEF Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The US said the proposal was unnecessary given existing guidance to the GEF, while the EU and others opposed reference to the conformity of the RAF with the MOU. The Co-Chairs will consult informally.
417	2005	enb12290e	['Israel']	Post-2012: ROMANIA welcomed discussions on a post-2012 framework as an opportunity for “intense cooperation among all governments.” HUNGARY said changes since the 1990s meant it was timely to review approaches to climate change, and supported President Dion’s efforts. JAPAN said Kyoto should be used as a springboard on the “long journey to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” and supported work on Article 3.9 and a broader approach to create an effective framework where all Parties participate. FINLAND said the negotiations on Article 3.9 should be placed in the wider context of global efforts and common but differentiated responsibilities. Many speakers, including TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, INDONESIA, ISRAEL, CHILE, PERU and PARAGUAY also supported discussions in the context of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.
419	2005	enb12290e	['Turkey']	Technology Development and Transfer: ENIN, COTE D’IVOIRE, PARAGUAY, EGYPT and ALGERIA highlighted the importance of technology transfer to address climate change. UGANDA said the first step on technology transfer has yet to be taken, and called for incentives and access to clean technology. SAUDI ARABIA stressed the need to find ways to continue to use fossil fuels while reducing emissions. LIBYA welcomed the IPCC report on carbon dioxide capture and storage. KUWAIT highlighted carbon dioxide capture and storage and urged addressing adaptation to response measures and economic diversification under UNFCCC Article 2.3. SPAIN stressed that climate change is an ethical challenge and the role of renewable energies. TURKEY emphasized renewable energies, in particular hydropower.
637	2005	enb12288e	['United States']	SIDS: Chair Benrageb proposed holding the agenda item on follow up to the International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of SIDS in abeyance. The US opposed this, stating that it considers that the issue was concluded at SBSTA 22. Tuvalu, for AOSIS, stressed that the Mauritius Strategy has been accepted as the UN programme for SIDS, and is recognized by the General Assembly. The EU and AUSTRALIA expressed disappointment that no progress was made. The matter was taken up in informal consultations to decide whether the issue should remain on SBSTA’s agenda. Following discussions on the usefulness of holding an item in abeyance  ad infinitum as opposed to exploring other options such as side events or workshops, Parties finally agreed at 12:30 am to include this item in the provisional agenda for SBSTA 24.
519	2005	enb12287e	['Canada', 'United States']	DEFORESTATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: Chair Hernán Carlino (Argentina) presented draft conclusions. Papua New Guinea, for the G-77/CHINA and supported by many Parties, stressed the need to address both technical and policy aspects of this issue, and suggested including a reference to consideration by SBI as well as SBSTA. The G-77/CHINA also called for more expedited consideration of this issue by the COP and, supported by AUSTRALIA, CANADA and others, proposed including reference to incentives. The EU, US, ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP and others preferred the text as presented, with the US emphasizing the discussion under SBSTA. The EU said submissions could also be sought from observer organizations. Informal consultations will continue.
459	2005	enb12285e	['Canada', 'United States']	ADAPTATION: Delegates proceeded through the Co-Chairs’ draft annex on the SBSTA programme of work on adaptation, addressing specific activities in the programme. Many Parties underscored the need for a more focused approach, engaging outside experts and users, and encouraging long-term cooperation. The G-77/CHINA and others called for a two-track approach that could address more urgent needs, as well as establishment of an expert group, bottom-up approaches, and some shorter deadlines. CANADA suggested requesting a technical report on analytical tools for adaptation planning and development, and on assessment of adaptation options. The EU proposed a web-based adaptation case-study database, and the US called for engagement with sectoral experts. AUSTRALIA, supported by many others, noted the need for more than one workshop to stimulate ongoing collaborative work. Informal consultations continued throughout the day.
555	2005	enb12289e	['Norway']	Post-2012: IRELAND, MALTA, REPUBLIC OF KOREA and others supported launching a process at this conference, and NORWAY supported more ambitious commitments. The G-77/CHINA, MALAYSIA, BOLIVIA, SOUTH AFRICA, NETHERLANDS, COLOMBIA, EC, PANAMA and MEXICO stressed the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Several supported President Dion’s latest proposal under the UNFCCC, while the G-77/CHINA supported addressing future commitments under Protocol Article 3.9. TANZANIA, NAMIBIA and others suggested engaging developing countries on a voluntary basis, combined with enforceable commitments by others. While noting the need not to impose ideas on developing countries, GERMANY called for a post-2012 regime built on the architecture of the Protocol.
556	2005	enb12289e	['United States']	SOUTH AFRICA proposed a two-track approach consisting of bolstering the Protocol and supporting developing countries so that they can do their fair share. COLOMBIA said a single, comprehensive regime is needed. BOLIVIA said the value of avoided deforestation should be recognized in the new commitment period. DENMARK stressed the need for a clear timetable for deciding a post-2012 framework. NEW ZEALAND supported a post-2012 regime that effectively reduces emissions, is fair and equitable, cost effective, and economically viable. The US said that all countries must be included in combating climate change. She also highlighted the value of bilateral and multilateral partnerships.
554	2005	enb12289e	['United Kingdom']	Kyoto Protocol Commitments:  Several Annex I Parties emphasized their commitment to meeting their targets. The UK, speaking for the EU, ROMANIA and BULGARIA, noted an expected additional 1.3% reduction by 2010 over the EU’s 8% target. She urged the adoption of a compliance mechanism and pledged to support the CDM, stating that future work will include seeking a 15-30% reduction in emissions by 2020 and supporting an open and innovative dialogue with all countries. LITHUANIA said it will meet its Kyoto obligations.
461	2005	enb12285e	['Norway', 'Switzerland']	Adaptation Fund: The EU and G-77/CHINA each presented draft decisions. The EU highlighted using a sliding scale on co-financing to measure additional costs. The G-77/CHINA noted the need for an MOU between the COP-MOP and the operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention and the need to avoid the “onerous operational policies on eligibility criteria,” including “incremental costs.” The G-77/CHINA said that its proposal should be used as the basis for negotiations, while the EU, supported by NORWAY and SWITZERLAND, said the Co-Chairs should produce a draft based on both proposals. A compilation of the two documents will be prepared in time for Saturday’s meeting. However, the Co-Chairs indicated that it would not necessarily form the basis for negotiations, as Parties first had to discuss how to proceed.
520	2005	enb12287e	['Belarus']	DETERMINATION OF A QUANTIFIED EMISSION REDUCTION COMMITMENT FOR BELARUS: Informal consultations were convened by Andrej Kranjc (Slovenia). At least one negotiating group raised concerns that an amendment to the Protocol would be needed for Belarus to become an Annex B Party. Further consultations are expected.
702	2005	enb12283e	['Belarus']	QUANTIFIED EMISSION REDUCTION COMMITMENT FOR BELARUS: BELARUS indicated that it is seeking to define its quantified emission reduction commitment as 95 per cent of the 1990 level, and to introduce a corresponding amendment to Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol. President Dion, with assistance of Andrej Kranjc (Slovenia), will hold informal consultations.
553	2005	enb12289e	['Ukraine']	Flexible Mechanisms:  Several Parties highlighted the need to improve or streamline the mechanisms. PANAMA noted the need to reduce transaction costs, COLOMBIA called for a transparent and efficient institutional framework, and MEXICO said the CDM should enhance and complement national efforts. GUINEA BISSAU highlighted the link between the CDM and poverty reduction, and the need for technology transfer. MOROCCO supported projects on renewables. BELGIUM said carbon markets will lead to necessary economic changes, while UKRAINE emphasized the need to fine-tune the CDM and JI.
597	2005	enb12284e	['Canada']	METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES: Implications of the CDM for Other Environmental Treaties: Chair Bï¿½rsting explained that, based on Partiesï¿½ submissions and views, three options to address perverse incentives from the crediting of HFC-23 destruction had been identified: to adopt principles that would apply to CDM baseline methodologies; to agree on more specific measures to avoid negative impacts of such projects undergoing the CDM approval process; and to exclude HFC-23 destruction from crediting. COLOMBIA, PERU and others supported exclusion, while CHINA, the EU, CANADA, and others suggested considering various technical options. Chair Bï¿½rsting will prepare a draft text.
705	2005	enb12283e	['Canada', 'United States', 'United Kingdom']	COMMON REPORTING FORMAT (CRF) FOR LULUCF: The US suggested reporting net national totals including all sources and sinks. The UK, CANADA and AUSTRALIA opposed this and stressed the need to distinguish sinks in the reporting to ensure transparency and comparability. AUSTRALIA, with TUVALU, called for a focus on emissions and removals instead of on stock changes. On how to address unmanaged lands, TUVALU cautioned that distinguishing between managed and unmanaged lands is inconsistent with the UNFCCC and stressed the need to account for all sources. María José Sanz (Spain) will facilitate informal discussions.
704	2005	enb12283e	['United States']	TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER: Co-Chairs Holger Liptow (Germany) and Carlos Fuller (Belize) asked participants to provide initial thoughts on this issue. The US, EU and JAPAN supported adopting the 2006 Work Plan of the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) as proposed, while Malaysia and Ghana, both speaking for the G-77/CHINA, suggested some additions. Discussion focused on an EGTT paper on publicly-owned technologies and technologies in the public domain, and on holding a high-level round table. The Co-Chairs will prepare draft text.
703	2005	enb12283e	['United States']	UNFCCC ARTICLE 6: Contact groupChair Crispin D’Auvergne (Saint Lucia) invited comments on implementing Article 6 (education, training and public awareness). The US suggested synthesizing results of recent workshops. On the new CC:iNet online information clearinghouse and funding issues, the EU said CC:iNet needs ongoing funding and that submissions could be requested in 2006 on all Article 6 issues, including CC:iNet. The David Suzuki Foundation, for CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK, said NGOs can play a cost-effective role in implementing Article 6. Chair D’Auvergne said draft text would be prepared by Thursday morning.
701	2005	enb12283e	['Russia', 'Canada', 'Norway']	COMPLIANCE: On the Protocol’s compliance mechanism, SAUDI ARABIA noted its proposal to amend the Protocol and called for an independent, legally-binding instrument. The EU, supported by others, said the compliance procedure should be adopted by a COP/MOP 1 decision, and should be operationalized without delay, after which an amendment could be considered. The G-77/CHINA said an amendment process could be initiated at COP/MOP 1. CANADA cautioned that such a process could be unpredictable. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said adoption of the compliance mechanism by a COP/MOP 1 decision would imply a recommendatory rather than legally-binding system. JAPAN opposed an amendment. Harald Dovland (Norway) and Mamadou Honadia (Burkina Faso) will co-chair a contact group.
707	2005	enb12283e	['United States']	MATTERS RELATING TO LDCS: Delegates discussed a new mandate and terms of reference for the LDC Expert Group (LEG), focusing on clarifying how the LEG will assist LDCs in implementing NAPAs, and the length of the LEG’s new mandate. Samoa, for the LDCs, said the LEG’s mandate should be three years, while the EU, US, JAPAN and others preferred two years. The Co-Chairs will prepare a draft decision and consult informally prior to it being considered by the contact group on Friday.
700	2005	enb12283e	['Russia']	JOINT IMPLEMENTATION (JI): On implementation of Protocol Article 6 (JI), the EU urged prompt agreement on practical measures to operationalize JI, and stressed the EU’s commitment to securing adequate and prompt payment of the costs. Several Parties emphasized the value of learning from the CDM. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said financial sources for the JI Supervisory Committee should come from contributions from Annex I Parties and registration fees for JI projects. He identified the need to define small-scale JI projects and called for a COP/MOP 1 decision. China, for the G-77/CHINA, underscored clear guidelines for “real and measurable” reductions. Daniela Stoytcheva (Bulgaria) will chair a contact group on JI, and Marcia Levaggi (Argentina) will hold consultations on membership of the Supervisory Committee.
706	2005	enb12283e	['Canada']	CRITERIA FOR CASES OF FAILURE TO SUBMIT INFORMATION ON LULUCF UNDER THE PROTOCOL: Co-Chair Rosland noted various issues that needed to be addressed, including defining the proper basis for measurement, establishing thresholds, and whether to have separate criteria for omissions. JAPAN suggested taking into account adjustments and “conservativeness factors” already applied to LULUCF reporting and, with the EU, NEW ZEALAND and CANADA, called for a simple, effective and comparable approach. Informal consultations will be held.
514	2006	enb12308e	['Belarus']	BELARUS outlined its proposal to amend Annex B to the Kyoto Protocol and expressed hope that a decision would be reached at this meeting. The EU stressed the need to operationalize the Adaptation Fund and strengthen the capacities of the LDCs to implement CDM projects. She highlighted the need to review and enhance the Protocol in accordance with its Article 9. The G-77/CHINA urged progress on adaptation and improving the geographical distribution of CDM projects.
141	2006	enb12309e	['United States']	Artur Runge-Metzger, European Commission, described the EU’s agreed policy of aiming to limit global temperature rise to 2°C Celsius, based on a stabilization of concentrations at 450ppm. He said this would mean emissions reductions of between 60-80% by 2050 for industrialized countries, assuming US participation.
213	2006	enb12311e	['Norway', 'Switzerland', 'United States']	PROTOCOL ARTICLE 9 (REVIEW OF PROTOCOL): Many parties underscored the importance of IPCC’s AR4 and highlighted issues such as the CDM, adaptation, bunker fuels, technology transfer and LULUCF. South Africa, for the AFRICA GROUP, with INDIA, IRAN and others, supported a short and focused review. The UMBRELLA GROUP (except the US), the EU and SWITZERLAND supported a thorough review of all aspects of the Protocol and, opposed by CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA, INDIA, EGYPT and others, underscored linkages between the AWG and the review. JAPAN highlighted the “three tracks” (UNFCCC Dialogue, Article 9 review and AWG), while BRAZIL responded that there are only “two tracks” (Dialogue and AWG). SWITZERLAND, supported by the EU and NORWAY, proposed launching a process to conduct the review. BRAZIL, CHINA, INDIA, and OMAN opposed this, noting that Article 9 refers to a review “at” COP/MOP 2.
264	2006	enb12310e	['United States']	IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION 1/CP.10: Parties discussed reports from the intersessional and presessional activities on the impacts of response measures mandated under Decision 1/CP.10. Regarding an expert meeting focused on tools and methodologies for modeling and on financial risk management (FCCC/SBI/2006/13), parties discussed a list of topics proposed for further consideration. SAUDI ARABIA noted the value of providing guidance to modelers on useful outcomes. However, Portugal, for the EU, said “it is not for us to tell them [modelers] what to do, but rather to pay attention” to their work. AUSTRALIA noted the value of different forums for information exchange and the wider relevance of economic diversification beyond the climate change process. Informal consultations will take place on Thursday.
710	2006	enb12312e	['Norway', 'Switzerland']	BUNKER FUELS: Chair Kumarsingh announced that informal consultations had not resulted in an agreement on how to move forward. He reported that one party had indicated that it would not be willing to work on this item unless progress was also made on Protocol Article 2.3. A number of parties expressed disappointment at the lack of progress. The EU proposed a detailed and results-focused discussion, and called for a UNFCCC workshop on methodological issues. MICRONESIA urged “real progress,” highlighting an increase in emissions from international aviation and calling for greater momentum so that these emissions can be properly addressed in a post-2012 framework. NORWAY expressed regret that this issue had not moved forward “due to the objections of a small number of countries” and noted that a COP decision had been taken on this nearly a decade ago. ARGENTINA called for urgent action on this matter, and SWITZERLAND insisted that methodological work should proceed. Chair Kumarsingh proposed, and parties agreed, to continue consideration of this matter at SBSTA 26. Following this agreement, NORWAY announced its intention to host a (non-UNFCCC) technical meeting on emissions from aviation and maritime transport in October 2007. The EU welcomed this initiative.
709	2006	enb12312e	['United States']	The EU added that a key issue for consideration within SBSTA is the treatment of geological CCS in national inventories to ensure leakage is properly accounted for. However, the US opposed consideration of inventory issues at this session.
708	2006	enb12312e	['Canada']	Carbon capture and storage (CCS): The Secretariat briefed delegates on the in-session workshop on the IPCC Special Report on CCS held at SBSTA 24. Parties discussed various technical, legal and oceans-related matters. Noting the need to adequately address technical and operational issues, in particular permanence and leakage, BRAZIL and INDONESIA opposed early application of CCS. The EU recognized geological CCS as part of a range of mitigation options but, with others, expressed serious concerns about ocean storage. CANADA said CCS is a key option for mitigation that could serve as a bridge towards a low-carbon world, and JAPAN proposed to advance CCS for implementation. KUWAIT and EGYPT supported consideration of CCS under the CDM.
712	2006	enb12312e	['Canada']	On the Secretariat’s role, the EU encouraged provision of legal advice and a neutral forum for parties. CANADA noted financial implications of the Secretariat’s= role as legal advisor. BRAZIL enquired about ways to discourage incentives for dispute claims. Chair Watkinson will prepare a draft COP/MOP decision.
263	2006	enb12310e	['United States']	FINANCIAL MECHANISM (CONVENTION): The contact group began consideration of the third review of the financial mechanism on the basis of SB 24 conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2006/L.4). Delegates discussed preambular paragraphs containing references to mitigation and adaptation. The G-77/CHINA stressed adaptation as the key concern in light of common but differentiated responsibilities. The EU favored mitigation in accordance with the Convention and COP guidance, and the US proposed references to both mitigation and adaptation as parties’ key concerns. On operative paragraphs, delegates discussed references to: GEF’s fourth replenishment; outcomes of its Third Assembly; RAF mid-term review; and informing the GEF’s fifth replenishment negotiations.
260	2006	enb12310e	['Russia', 'Canada']	The AWG began with general statements. South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA, said discussions should be limited to Protocol Article 3.9 (future commitments) and not linked to other articles. The EU stressed that action by Annex I parties to the Protocol is not sufficient to tackle climate change. AUSTRALIA said a future framework should include all major emitters, CANADA stressed the need to make it easier to extend the “Kyoto family” and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION underscored voluntary commitments. The G-77/CHINA, LDCs, CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK and others called for more ambitious targets for Annex I parties, while the RUSSIAN FEDERATION emphasized considering national circumstances when determining targets.
142	2006	enb12309e	['Canada']	José Domingos Gonzalez Miguez, Brazil’s Ministry of Science and Technology, presented the Brazilian proposal emphasizing historical responsibility and shifting the focus from emissions to temperature increase. FINLAND suggested the AWG look into differentiation methodologies and not just historical responsibility, while CANADA said such responsibility is “nuanced.” AWG Chair Zammit Cutajar wondered if current discussions on further emissions reductions by Annex I countries should consider this broader historical approach.
711	2006	enb12312e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'Norway']	AWG ISSUES: Chair Zammit Cutajar convened the second meeting of the contact group on AWG issues. On the AWG work schedule, NORWAY proposed a workshop on LULUCF. Participants discussed inputs to the AWG from a number of organizations, including NGO think tanks and the CDM Executive Board. CHILE cautioned against duplication of ongoing work in the COP/MOP. The EU, supported by CANADA and SWITZERLAND, noted a linkage between the work of the AWG and work on Article 9 (review of the Protocol). On outcomes, SWITZERLAND stressed the need for analytical outputs to assist the formulation of new commitments. NORWAY, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, repeated a call for work on defining a long-term goal, given the limited value of UNFCCC Article 2 (Objective) in defining a long-term path. SAUDI ARABIA cautioned the AWG against exceeding its mandate. CHINA called for a strong signal to the carbon markets in the form of new Annex I commitments. Chair Zammit Cutajar will convene informal consultations. He invited Saudi Arabia to work with others to identify Protocol articles that may need amendment to facilitate new commitments.
513	2006	enb12308e	['Belarus', 'Turkmenistan', 'Ukraine', 'Kazakhstan', 'Russia', 'Canada']	INFORMATION ABOUT THE BASE YEAR OF KAZAKHSTAN: KAZAKHSTAN reported on its greenhouse gas emissions inventory, requesting that 1992 be adopted as the base year for determining quantitative commitments. He also noted his country’s forthcoming ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION, UKRAINE, TURKMENISTAN and BELARUS welcomed Kazakhstan’s intention to take on voluntary commitments and ratify the Protocol. Finland, on behalf of the EU, said amending the Protocol’s Annex B at COP 12 is not possible. She encouraged Kazakhstan to first ratify the Protocol and defer consideration of its request to COP/MOP 3. Normand Tremblay (Canada) will hold informal consultations.
261	2006	enb12310e	['Canada', 'United States']	ADAPTATION FIVE-YEAR PROGRAMME OF WORK: Co-Chair Helen Plume (New Zealand) presented text containing the initial activities of the work programme (FCCC/SBSTA/2006/CRP.1). France, for the EU, supported by CANADA, expressed concern about the chapeau paragraphs. The US, CANADA and MEXICO stressed that the current mandate of this meeting is to agree on the initial list of activities. The G-77/CHINA noted the importance of clarifying the content and outcome of the sub-themes in the list of activities. On the possible establishment of an expert group, she underscored the need for a focal point to facilitate linkages between the various adaptation initiatives and proposed referring instead to a working group. The EU, AUSTRALIA, CANADA and US entered a reservation on this until the initial list of activities is decided. Informal consultations will continue on Thursday.
750	2006	enb12315e	['United Kingdom']	OTHER MATTERS: Level of emissions for Croatia’s base year: Jim Penman (UK) reported on the outcomes of informal consultations, and the SBI adopted the draft decision (FCCC/SBI/2006/L.20). The EU noted that the decision does not affect Croatia’s baseline for the purposes of implementation of Protocol Article 3.4 (LULUCF additional activities).
723	2006	enb12317e	['United States', 'United Kingdom']	CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RESPONSES: Parties then exchanged views on “concrete actions that would enable parties to continue to develop effective and appropriate national and international responses to climate change.” The US outlined other mechanisms including incentives, voluntary product labeling, tax breaks and companies taking voluntary action to generate a positive public image. FRANCE advocated clean energy and selecting the right technologies for future reduction targets. He also asked for in-depth analysis of emission trends in time for the next workshop. The UK noted the need to move away from the “black and white world” of Annex I and non-Annex I parties by “developing shades of grey” such as those outlined in the Pocantico Dialogue, and proposed a workshop to further explore the role of the private sector, government and public finance in the future framework.
262	2006	enb12310e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER: The EU and G-77/CHINA each introduced draft decisions on the issue. The US, AUSTRALIA, SWITZERLAND and others supported using the EU text as the basis for negotiations. This text proposes continuation of the framework and the EGTT. The longer G-77/China proposal includes, inter alia: setting up a technology development and transfer board, which would be a standing body reporting directly to COP; a new financial mechanism, the multilateral technology acquisition fund, to facilitate the “buy out” of intellectual property rights; the possibility of creating technology development and transfer credits; and developing performance indicators to monitor progress in technology transfer. The US noted problems with the proposed fund and WTO rules. GEORGIA stressed lack of representation of EIT countries in the EGTT. Informal consultations continued into the night.
143	2006	enb12309e	['Norway']	BUNKER FUELS: The International Maritime Organization (IMO) reported on its work on emissions from international shipping.

433	2008	enb12394e	['United Kingdom']	CHINA outlined various domestic mitigation efforts and said any attempt to merge the dual negotiating tracks agreed in Bali would be detrimental and lead to a “fruitless” Copenhagen conference. The UK drew attention to a statement of intent on REDD by various developing and developed countries planned for Friday, and highlighted the UK’s contribution of £100 million for forestry activities. FINLAND endorsed enhancing women’s role as agents for change.
54	2008	enb12389e	['Russia', 'Canada']	SPILLOVER EFFECTS (AWG-KP): South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA, suggested a focus on scope, further analysis and possible solutions. JAPAN, CANADA, AUSTRALIA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION noted the relevance of these issues to all parties, said both negative and positive implications should be considered, and highlighted co-benefits. CHINA said the AWG-KP must focus on Annex I parties and that this discussion should focus on adverse impacts. The EU disagreed, preferring a balanced view.
469	2008	enb12393e	['Norway']	CCS under the CDM: Co-Chair Wollansky reported that parties had considered two bracketed options, but that differences remained on forwarding bracketed text to the COP/MOP or to a later SBSTA session. Parties adopted short draft conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2008/L.21) and this matter will be taken up in SBSTA 30.  The EU, SAUDI ARABIA, AUSTRALIA, NORWAY and JAPAN expressed regret that agreement had not been reached. JAMAICA noted that CCS technology is not ready for use in an offset mechanism such as the CDM. BRAZIL highlighted concerns relating to long-term permanence and host-country liabilities.
127	2008	enb12390e	['Canada']	DELIVERING ON TECHNOLOGY AND FINANCING (AWG-LCA): In the contact group, AWG-LCA Chair Machado invited comments to further clarify proposals and explore areas of convergence and difference. The EU, supported by NEW ZEALAND and CANADA, said any financial architecture should be based on principles of effectiveness, efficiency and equity. JAPAN suggested differentiating among countries for provision of financial and technological support and, with AUSTRALIA, supported focusing on the existing financial architecture.
403	2009	enb12457e	['United States']	Andreas Calgren, Minister for the Environment of Sweden, for the EU, urged parties not to leave Copenhagen without a legally-binding, ambitious, global and comprehensive agreement for all countries, including actions from developed countries and emerging economies. He called on the US to adopt legally-binding, economy-wide emission reduction commitments and on China to adopt binding actions, urging these countries to “unleash their full potential” to enable the world to achieve the objective of limiting the global temperature increase to below 2°C.
11	2009	enb12450e	['Russia']	The EU requested information on whether carrying over Assigned Amount Units (AAUs) from the first to the second commitment period was included as an assumption in the emission reduction range in the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report of 25-40% from 1990 levels, in order to further clarify the relation between level of ambition and what is required by science. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION highlighted its recent pledge to reduce emissions by 20-25% from 1990 levels by 2020. The Federated States of Micronesia, for AOSIS, emphasized the gap between what is required by science and the 13-19% aggregate reduction reflected by the current pledges. She stressed that this level of ambition is far from the pathway desired by vulnerable countries.
646	2009	enb12448e	['United States']	COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING: Leaders of Commonwealth countries convened from 27-29 November in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, for the biannual Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. They were joined by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen. Focusing on climate change, they issued a declaration stating that only a “few short years” remain to address the climate threat and that an “internationally legally-binding agreement is essential.” They also, inter alia, welcomed the initiative to establish a Copenhagen Launch Fund for developing countries, to start in 2010 and build to US$10 billion per year by 2012.
12	2009	enb12450e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	REDD (SBSTA): In the contact group on REDD, parties discussed the draft COP decision text in Annex I of document FCCC/SBSTA/2009/3. INDONESIA and the EU called for clarification on the division of work on REDD under the SBSTA and AWG-LCA. PAPUA NEW GUINEA, CHILE, Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, and others said discussion on reference levels should be a priority. GUYANA and COLOMBIA stressed the need to create opportunities for countries with low deforestation rates to participate. BRAZIL and the EU called for national forest monitoring systems. BRAZIL expressed concern with language on independent review. NEW ZEALAND, the US, INDIA, the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, PERU and others said language on independent review is needed, while CHINA suggested that discussion of review occur under the AWG-LCA. PARAGUAY, COLOMBIA and others supported text on engagement of indigenous peoples.
64	2009	enb12458e	['Russia', 'Switzerland']	KENYA questioned the rationale for establishing new drafting groups facilitated by the same people, considering their inability to complete the work so far. He questioned the approach whereby “Ministers are now becoming drafting committees.” COP President’s Special Representative Hedegaard explained that the presence of the Ministers could act as an impetus for the groups to complete their work. In response to comments by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, the EU and SWITZERLAND, COP President’s Special Representative Hedegaard reiterated that the drafting groups would report back to the contact group, and that the contact group would then, with the help of the Ministers, address outstanding political issues.
100	2009	enb12455e	['Canada']	CANADA requested further time to discuss potential consequences. Chair Ure proposed sending the text forward and asked parties whether this should take the form of a decision or conclusions. Noting the state of the text, the EU said it was too early to determine its status as a decision. The text will be forwarded to the AWG-KP plenary.
65	2009	enb12458e	['Canada', 'Iceland']	Parties then discussed how to move forward. Sweden, for the EU, supported by JAPAN, COLOMBIA, CANADA, the MARSHALL ISLANDS, ICELAND, AUSTRALIA, GUYANA and many others, supported establishing a “friends of the chair” group.
610	2009	enb12452e	['Belarus']	PROPOSALS BY PARTIES FOR PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS: The Secretariat introduced twelve proposed Protocol amendments (FCCC/KP/CMP/2009/2-13), which had been received from: Australia; Belarus; Bolivia for several countries; Colombia; Japan; the EU; New Zealand; Papua New Guinea; the Philippines; China for several non-Annex I countries; and two from Tuvalu.
131	2009	enb12454e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'Norway']	The EU, with JAPAN, CANADA and SWITZERLAND, stressed that a global, ambitious and comprehensive agreement is required to preserve the environmental integrity of the Convention. The EU highlighted the importance of further progress on, inter alia, LULUCF, surplus AAUs and the flexibility mechanisms. JAPAN underscored action by all major emitters. NORWAY called for either a new commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol or a single binding agreement and stressed that work on LULUCF and the flexibility mechanisms should go forward.
132	2009	enb12454e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	Sudan, for the G-77/CHINA, Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, Lesotho, for the LDCs, Sweden, for the EU, Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, and Uganda, for the LDC Expert Group, welcomed progress at SBI 31, but noted the importance of issues postponed to later sessions. The LDCs called for full support of the LDC work programme, including contribution by developed countries of US$ 2 billion to the LDC Fund.
611	2009	enb12452e	['United States']	Regarding the report on GHG inventory data for 1990–2007, China, for the G-77/CHINA, with BRAZIL, expressed concern at the trend of increase of GHG emissions in Annex I parties and suggested reflecting this concern in SBI conclusions. The EU noted that its member states are undertaking significant reductions and proposed that SBI conclusions take note of the report (FCCC/SBI/2009/12). The US suggested using language from previous SBI conclusions, and the Secretariat explained that relevant language on emission trends is contained in decision    1/CP.9.
609	2009	enb12452e	['Switzerland', 'Kazakhstan']	AUSTRALIA welcomed mitigation commitments from new countries and supported discussing the item. The EU recognized Kazakhstan’s aspiration to join Annex B, while highlighting the need to comply with legal requirements relating to Annex B amendments. She supported deferring the issue to COP/MOP 6. KAZAKHSTAN stressed that her country has been communicating relevant information to parties since June. Stephan Michel (Switzerland) will consult informally.
612	2009	enb12452e	['Russia', 'United States']	Regarding the report on the review of fourth national communications and preparations for the fifth national communications, Co-Chair Herold reminded parties that according to decision 10/CP.13, Annex I parties are expected to submit a fifth national communication on 1 January 2010 “with a view to submitting the sixth national communication four years after this date,” that is on 1 January 2014. The US, EU, AUSTRALIA and RUSSIAN FEDERATION suggested deciding on the exact date for submitting the sixth national communication at a later stage, pending the outcome of AWG-LCA discussions. The G-77/CHINA, with BRAZIL, proposed fixing the date at this session.
639	2009	enb12456e	['Canada']	On improving regional distribution, SAUDI ARABIA reiterated their proposal that the provision exempting SIDS from payment of the registration fee and share of proceeds, as well as that establishing a quota for projects hosted in LDCs, SIDS and African countries, should be extended to all developing countries with fewer than ten registered projects. GRENADA, supported by PERU and the EU, and opposed by UGANDA, preferred deleting the paragraph exempting SIDS from payment of fees and retaining the option permitting postponement of the payment of fees by parties with fewer than ten registered projects, noting that exempting all countries with fewer than ten projects could negatively impact functioning of the CDM Executive Board. JAPAN and CANADA noted the need to specify that the payment would be postponed until the first issuance of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs).
638	2009	enb12456e	['Norway']	ALGERIA requested going through all the decisions included in the package one-by-one. Many parties then expressed their concern with the texts and provided detailed proposals for changes, focusing first on document FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/L7. Sudan, for the G-77/CHINA, suggested bracketing text in the section on finance, in particular with regard to developed country pledges for short-term financing. Bangladesh, for LDCs, with the UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA and the Cook Islands, for AOSIS, proposed a reference to special concerns of LDCs, SIDS and African countries in the text on adaptation. NORWAY and MEXICO noted that their proposals on financing arrangements should be reflected in full. BOLIVIA noted, inter alia, her country’s textual proposals on a shared vision and indigenous peoples. JAPAN noted “strong concerns” on, inter alia, mitigation and legal outcome. The EU stressed the need to convey their concerns to the COP President on issues including on a legally binding outcome and mitigation.
101	2009	enb12455e	['Switzerland']	OTHER ISSUES (METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES)(AWG-KP): In the “other issues” contact group focusing on methodological issues, Vice-Chair Dovland noted that the Chair’s draft text added six preambular “uncontroversial and factual” paragraphs, mentioning, inter alia, that trifluoromethyl sulfur pentafluoride had been added to the list of greenhouse gases to be reported. BRAZIL preferred no change in greenhouse gases and suggested that adding new gases that are reported but not accounted for may result in a “loophole.” AUSTRALIA, the FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA and SWITZERLAND supported estimating and reporting new greenhouse gases. The EU noted that adding new gases would require an amendment of the Protocol and Vice-Chair Dovland said there would be a placeholder in the text for amending Protocol Annex A. The FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA suggested consideration of such language that does not require an amendment of Annex A. JAPAN highlighted environmental integrity, but said technical details require further clarification. PERU suggested that this is an issue for the SBSTA.
735	2009	enb12451e	['Norway', 'United States']	SAUDI ARABIA emphasized that the Chair’s text does not reflect the submissions of the G-77/China and that the current text reflects “starting from the beginning.” AUSTRALIA, NORWAY and the US supported using the draft text as the basis for discussions. The EU suggested it would be helpful to look at the submissions and outcomes of workshops, drawing out common elements and inserting them in the text.
734	2009	enb12451e	['Norway', 'United States']	FINANCIAL MECHANISM (SBI): On the fourth review of the financial mechanism, the EU proposed streamlining the draft conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2009/L.15/Rev.1) by deleting several preambular paragraphs. AUSTRALIA and NORWAY called for a focus on core issues. The US said its Congress was considering a request for US$ 50 million for the GEF for various climate change activities, to be included in the 2010 budget. The contact group was then suspended following a request from the Bahamas, for the G-77/CHINA, to enable the Group to coordinate.
133	2009	enb12454e	['Russia', 'Canada']	On regional distribution, SENEGAL requested specific reference to project activities in SIDS and African countries. SAUDI ARABIA, ARGENTINA and PERU preferred reference to all developing countries. NEW ZEALAND, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN and CANADA said they could not support the encouragement of introducing quotas for Certified Emission Reductions originating from LDCs, SIDS and Africa during the second commitment period. CANADA and the EU proposed the removal of specific percentages, as a compromise. BRAZIL, with CHINA, supported a return to Chair’s original text on regional distribution. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA and AUSTRALIA called for discussion of credits from new market mechanisms.
102	2009	enb12455e	['Norway']	PERU proposed including a section on accounting for the flexibility mechanisms, limiting the amounts that can be added to, or subtracted from, the Assigned Amounts of a party through the flexibility mechanisms. The EU, supported by NORWAY, proposed having an option stating that no decision should be taken on this issue. GRENADA proposed inserting a preamble recognizing that developed countries shall achieve their QELROs primarily through domestic efforts.
733	2009	enb12451e	['Canada']	MALTA’S PROPOSAL FOR AN AMENDMENT TO CONVENTION ANNEX I: Malta outlined its proposal to join Annex I (FCCC/CP/2009/2), noting that by joining the EU in 2004 it has taken on responsibilities in line with those of Annex I parties. Stephen de Boer (Canada) will facilitate informal consultations.
190	2010	enb12493e	['Switzerland']	Yemen, for the G-77/CHINA, said that they could not provide an overview of the new text as it was just delivered. The EU commended the “constructive spirit of compromise,” urged further progress on mitigation and identified the need for a legally-binding outcome under both tracks. Switzerland, for the EIG, recognized the COP Presidency’s efforts to ensure a transparent, inclusive and result-oriented process, and welcomed the AWG-LCA Chair’s new text. Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, highlighted the importance of anchoring developed countries’ economy-wide targets, as well as mitigation actions submitted by developing countries, and urged further work on MRV and mitigation.
346	2010	enb12491e	['Canada']	On the Committee’s annual report and its request to the COP/MOP concerning the legal status of Committee members, AUSTRALIA, CANADA and the EU identified the discussions under the SBI on privileges and immunities as the best way to address this issue and proposed reflecting this in the COP/MOP decision.
345	2010	enb12491e	['Belarus']	Parties then discussed whether credits can be issued from projects in countries such as Belarus that are in the process of becoming Protocol Annex B parties. BELARUS highlighted that his country is ready to implement a number of JI projects using the Track 2 procedure, indicating that they are only waiting to achieve Annex B status. The EU said a decision on the issue cannot be taken now.
193	2010	enb12493e	['Norway']	Assessment of the SCCF: The EU and NORWAY requested, and parties agreed, to remove reference to economic diversification as no economic diversification activities had been undertaken. The SBI adopted conclusions and a draft decision (FCCC/SBI/2010/L.40 and Add.1) as amended.
191	2010	enb12493e	['Switzerland']	Yemen, for the G-77/CHINA, stressed that a second commitment period is the cornerstone of a successful outcome. Lesotho, for the LDCs, urged balance between the two tracks. Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, underscored the need to consider all parties’ mitigation targets and actions. He identified an opportunity to improve rules on greenhouse gases, LULUCF and common metrics. The EU expressed willingness to commit to a second commitment period as part of a global, binding framework. Switzerland, for the EIG, highlighted the need for political decisions and flexibility. Grenada, for AOSIS, called for an ambitious and balanced new text focusing on emission reduction targets.
192	2010	enb12493e	['United States']	CONVENTION ARTICLES 4.8 AND 4.9: Progress on implementation of decision 1/CP.10 (Buenos Aires programme of work): SAUDI ARABIA, supported by the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES and QATAR, noted that the issue had been pending for “a very long time” but requested that reference linking a workshop on 1/CP.10 to a workshop on Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14 be deleted. AUSTRALIA, with the EU and the US, noted that they had agreed to consider a workshop on Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14 on the understanding that it would be a “joint” workshop with 1/CP.10, but that it could be worded as either a workshop where the issues were “considered together” or “back-to-back.” SAUDI ARABIA underscored that distinct issues should not be linked.
337	2010	enb12494e	['United States']	Chair Zammit Cutajar noted that the discussion had repeated issues that have been discussed before, such as the idea that “the form follows function.” He noted, however, that some interventions, such as the statement by the US, seemed to “link the form and function.” He also emphasized that parties continue to express diverging views on what is “legally-binding,” and said all these differences “make summing up difficult.” He noted that both Venezuela and the EU had “in their different ways” proposed to link the outcomes of the two negotiating tracks, and encouraged parties to speak to each other.
343	2010	enb12491e	['Ukraine']	On the proposed fee, the EU expressed a willingness to discuss ways to ensure the JISC’s financial sustainability and highlighted the need for transparency concerning the JISC’s needs. UKRAINE identified the need to consult on the level of the proposed fee. JAPAN preferred focusing on other means, saying the proposed fee could discourage JI activities.
828	2010	enb12487e	['United States']	MAJOR ECONOMIES FORUM ON ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE (MEF): The MEF took place at the leaders’ representatives’ level in Crystal City, Virginia, US, from 17-18 November 2010. It was attended by ministers and officials from seventeen major economies as well as the UN, Barbados, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, New Zealand, Singapore and Spain. Participants expressed support for concluding a package of decisions in Cancun, including on adaptation, mitigation, transparency, finance and technology. Many participants also identified the need for agreement on future commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.
344	2010	enb12491e	['Ukraine']	On the post-2012 JI, UKRAINE identified the need for further explanations concerning the proposal to issue credits during the possible gap period. The EU identified the need to ensure the Protocol’s environmental integrity and also consider the issue in a broader context. The JOINT IMPLEMENTATION ACTION GROUP supported the JI’s continuation in the gap period, saying that it would: be a first step in providing the necessary long-term perspective; not weaken the targets or involve borrowing from future commitment periods; and not require changes to the Marrakesh Accords.
452	2010	enb12489e	['Norway']	Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) in geological formations under the CDM: SBSTA Chair Konaté highlighted a draft text forwarded by SBSTA 32. NORWAY, AUSTRALIA, SAUDI ARABIA and others supported the inclusion of CCS under the CDM, while BRAZIL and others expressed reservations. Pedro Martins Barata (Portugal) and Andrea García (Colombia) will consult informally.
613	2010	enb12497e	['Canada']	On the appeal by Croatia, BOLIVIA proposed broadening the scope of a proposed technical paper, aimed at outlining the process and applicable rules for the consideration of appeals, to include the consideration of legally-binding consequences for non-compliance. This was opposed by several parties, with CANADA emphasizing that the objective of the technical paper is to assist parties in moving forward with the appeal by Croatia. Bolivia then withdrew this proposal.
347	2010	enb12491e	['Canada']	Co-Chair Tarasofsky identified the possibility of adopting two COP/MOP decisions, one on the appeal and the other one on the broader issues related to Croatia’s situation. The EU highlighted the contact group’s “very specific mandate” to address Croatia’s appeal, while CANADA stated that the COP/MOP can take a comprehensive approach and also address the level of base year emissions. AUSTRALIA indicated that while the appeal must comply with the existing rules, it is also possible to address the broader issues.
355	2010	enb12492e	['United States']	PARTIES’ PROPOSALS UNDER CONVENTION ARTICLE 17 (protocols) (COP): Chair Michael Zammit Cutajar (Malta) opened the first contact group meeting. He explained that five proposals were submitted under Convention Article 17 before COP 15 by Australia, Costa Rica, Japan, the US and Tuvalu, and a sixth proposal was made by Grenada for AOSIS in 2010.
614	2010	enb12497e	['Canada']	BOLIVIA also proposed a new paragraph on the COP/MOP encouraging the SBI to conclude its work on agenda item 14 (amendments to the Kyoto Protocol with respect to procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance). The proposal was opposed by CANADA, the EU, JAPAN and AUSTRALIA who, acknowledging Bolivia’s concerns, emphasized that they do not fall within the remit of the group. The Cook Islands, for AOSIS, suggested that Bolivia raise the matter in the COP/MOP plenary. Parties agreed that Co-Chair Richard Tarasofsky (Canada) would raise Bolivia’s concerns in his oral report to the COP/MOP. Parties then agreed to forward the draft conclusions to the COP/MOP with other amendments.
451	2010	enb12489e	['United States']	Several parties highlighted the ICAO and IMO as the principle forums for addressing emissions from international aviation and maritime transportation. Many also stressed the importance of these sectors for developing countries. CUBA, for Argentina, Brazil, China, India and Saudi Arabia, supported by SOUTH AFRICA and others, stressed the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities. The US suggested considering how the IMO and ICAO should deal with the principle of common but differentiated responsabilities if it is not part of their mandate. ARGENTINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, highlighted reservations made to the ICAO resolution. The EU stressed the urgency of addressing emissions from bunker fuels, while highlighting the AWG-LCA as the best forum to do so. The COOK ISLANDS called for the IMO and ICAO to continue their consultations with SIDS. BRAZIL, supported by ARGENTINA and others, suggested that IMO and ICAO should continue reporting to the SBSTA.
517	2010	enb12490e	['Ukraine']	The EU supported continuation of Joint Implementation and expressed willingness to discuss further improvements and changes to its operation beyond 2012. UKRAINE highlighted that more work is needed before a decision can be finalized.
453	2010	enb12489e	['Norway', 'Switzerland']	Standardized baselines under the CDM: The Secretariat introduced the issue (FCCC/SBSTA/2010/MIC.13 and Add.1, FCCC/TP/2010/4). The EU, SWITZERLAND, AUSTRALIA and others highlighted the benefits of using standardized baselines under the CDM. BRAZIL underscored the importance of additionality and said standardized baselines would change the CDM’s nature, while PAPUA NEW GUINEA said they would be compatible with the current definition and make the CDM more efficient and objective. Peer Stiansen (Norway) and Hugh Sealy (Grenada) will consult informally.
518	2010	enb12490e	['Monaco']	COMPLIANCE: The Compliance Committee’s report: Compliance Committee Co-Chair Kunihiko Shimada presented the Committee’s report (FCCC/KP/CMP/2010/6), outlining the Committee’s consideration of various issues including: compliance issues relating to Bulgaria, the result of which was suspension of Bulgaria from participation in the flexibility mechanisms; matters relating to Croatia, highlighting that Croatia has not submitted a plan to address its non-compliance although the deadline for doing this has passed; and issues regarding what should be done in the event of Annex I parties failing to comply with their reporting requirements, highlighting that Monaco has not submitted its fifth national communication.
356	2010	enb12492e	['United States']	CAPACITY BUILDING (CONVENTION) (SBI): During the afternoon contact group, Co-Chair Marie Jaudet (France) introduced draft SBI conclusions and a draft COP decision. On a request to the GEF to increase its support to capacity-building activities in developing countries, the EU, supported by the US, JAPAN and others, suggested bracketing “increase” and proposed, instead, reference to “continue to provide financial support.” Noting the increasing need for support for capacity building activities, the G-77/CHINA opposed. Parties did not reach agreement and decided to continue consideration of this issue and the agenda item on capacity building under the Kyoto Protocol at the next SBI session.
634	2011	enb12530e	['United States']	Outside the negotiating room, high-level officials began outlining their positions. During press conferences, China laid out five conditions for participating in a legally-binding climate deal to come into force after 2020 and Brazil signaled that they wanted a “robust, legally-binding instrument and not just any instrument.” The EU continued to seek support for their proposal on a roadmap for a legally-binding agreement, with several AOSIS delegates indicating their strong preferences for early action under both tracks and “setting clear deadlines.” The US called for all countries to take on comparable legal commitments, even if the timelines for implementation might be different.
807	2011	enb12526e	['Switzerland']	DEVELOPING COUNTRY MITIGATION (AWG-LCA): During informal consultations, many parties expressed support for the non-papers as a basis for further discussions. BOLIVIA expressed concern that requirements being imposed on developed and developing countries are too similar. The EU reiterated that progress on these issues is a key part of the Durban package and suggested that text for a decision focus on the same areas identified for developed countries’ mitigation issues. Switzerland, for the EIG, highlighted three key issues: ambition and the need for information on the ambition gap; clarification of ambition; and common accounting rules.
777	2011	enb12527e	['United States']	LOSS AND DAMAGE (SBI): Facilitator Robert Owen-Jones invited comments on the draft text. Several speakers welcomed the text as a good basis for discussions. The US, EU and LDCs also suggested that the text on thematic areas could be further elaborated. On the form of the outcome, the Cook Islands, for AOSIS, preferred a COP decision rather than SBI conclusions. The EU suggested focusing first on content, then on the nature of the outcome. Facilitator Owen-Jones invited written inputs and indicated that the text would be revised in light of these.
448	2011	enb12533e	['United Kingdom']	COP President Nkoana-Mashabane announced ministerial appointments on key issues to further narrow the list of options. These assignments are: Minister Onkokame Mokaila of Botswana for shared vision; Minister Tim Groser of New Zealand for developed and developing country mitigation; Minister María Fernanda Espinosa of Ecuador for the Adaptation Committee; Special Envoy Claudia Salerno of Venezuela for response measures; Minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet of France on sectoral approaches; and Minister Chris Huhne of the UK for Review.
211	2011	enb12525e	['Norway']	The EU said any agreement would be piecemeal because the number of parties willing to work on a “meaningful Kyoto Protocol” has declined. He indicated, however, that progress might be made on carryover of surplus AAUs, and noted that avoiding a gap between commitment periods is necessary to give certainty to markets. NORWAY said the Kyoto Protocol alone is not enough to achieve a relevant reduction of global emissions.
806	2011	enb12526e	['United States']	On accounting, AUSTRALIA supported a common accounting framework for all parties. The EU said common accounting rules are key to increasing ambition and ensuring transparency. The US said the development of such rules was not mandated by the Cancun Agreements and suggested they be based on IPCC methodologies.
805	2011	enb12526e	['Belarus', 'Ukraine']	PROPOSALS FOR AMENDMENTS TO THE KYOTO PROTOCOL: INDIA said it will not agree to changes to Annex B unless a second commitment period is agreed. BELARUS, the EU and UKRAINE favored simplifying amendment procedures. Parties agreed to keep this item open, pending the results of the AWG-KP.
210	2011	enb12525e	['United States']	The EU called for a process to deliver a new global, comprehensive and legally-binding framework, to be completed by 2015. He reaffirmed his commitment to jointly mobilize US$100 billion annually by 2020.
125	2011	enb12528e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'United States', 'Norway']	In the afternoon, delegates considered a proposal by AOSIS on an international mechanism to address loss and damage. This was supported by the LDCs, SICA and several non-Annex I parties. The US, supported by the EU, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, SWITZERLAND, NORWAY and JAPAN, said she was not in a position to work towards the establishment of an international mechanism and would like to consider a range of approaches. SWITZERLAND said options must be explored before the ambition for COP 18 is stated. KENYA stressed the need to create linkages with the GCF. Delegates will consider a revised draft text on Saturday morning.
450	2012	enb12565e	['Switzerland']	 The PHILIPPINES, BANGLADESH and others emphasized the need for consultations on finance to be open, inclusive and transparent. Swaziland, for the AFRICAN GROUP, called for a decision on finance, scaling up mitigation and support for adaptation. SWITZERLAND said financing is a “core and ongoing issue” that cannot be concluded in Doha, and that a COP decision is needed to define how to continue working on it. The EU expressed disappointment over the lack of progress on, among other issues, shared vision and various approaches. She called for consensus text with clear options for ministers.
117	2012	enb12560e	['United States']	Arrangements between the GCF and the COP: Parties disagreed on which body should be responsible for drafting the arrangements between the GCF and the COP. The US and JAPAN stated that the key elements of the arrangements were already agreed upon and the GCF had independent juridical authority operating under the guidance of the COP and was therefore capable of drafting the arrangements. Barbados, for AOSIS, cautioned against reopening issues that are in the GCF Governing Instrument. He suggested a process to develop the arrangements involving representatives from both the COP and the GCF Board. SOUTH AFRICA said the GCF Governing Instrument already includes elements that would allow  the work on arrangements to be concluded in Doha. SAUDI ARABIA, supported by KENYA and Zambia, for the LDCs, stated that “arrangements between” two entities do not imply an equal relationship and expressed concern about the GCF drafting its own accountability relationship, suggesting that the Standing Committee should undertake this task. COLOMBIA, on behalf of Peru and Guatemala, proposed that representatives of the COP, possibly through the Standing Committee and the GCF Board work on drafting the arrangements to complete work by COP 19. The EU supported developing the arrangements in a cooperative manner and suggested a draft proposal be submitted for consideration by relevant bodies and approval by COP 19.

406	2012	enb12563e	['Switzerland']	The EU underscored that parties have been working on the issues of carry-over of AAUs and increasing ambition, calling for the “fruits of this work” to be tabled before forwarding the text to ministers. Saint Lucia, for AOSIS, and several developing countries, stressed the need to achieve a higher level of ambition. She lamented that some parties have dropped to the lower end of their pledges despite their clear mandate to move up to the top end of their pledges, and noted their conditionalities have been met with the creation of the ADP process. The PHILIPPINES urged parties to “walk fast, far and forward.” AUSTRALIA identified ambition as a broader issue that must be addressed beyond the Protocol’s second commitment period. SWITZERLAND identified addressing the carry-over of surplus AAUs as a way to raise ambition.
118	2012	enb12560e	['United States']	SBI/SBSTA: Response Measures Forum: The forum was co-chaired by Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) and Tomasz Chruszczow (Poland). Parties focused discussions on the implementation of the relevant decisions on response measures under the Convention and Protocol. Divergent views were expressed, inter alia, on the need for a review of all elements of the decisions, particularly decision 1/CP.10(Buenos Aires programme of work on adaptation and response measures). The US, supported by AUSTRALIA and the EU, suggested “closing” discussion of decision 1/CP.10 since those matters, such as adaptation, are being discussed in other bodies.SAUDI ARABIA, with the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, maintained that there has not been sufficient progress on the operational requirements for response measures and suggested an item-by-item review of the relevant aspects of the decisions. Argentina, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, cited gaps in the implementation of Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse effects). The EU said reporting on adverse impacts is a “learning process,” citing recent improvements in their national communications.
369	2012	enb12564e	['United Kingdom']	As if anticipating this call for mid-term finance, rumors circulated that the UK has become the first EU member state to make a pledge of post-2012 finance totaling € 2.2 billion.

511	2012	enb12558e	['Switzerland']	The EU stressed that for Doha to deliver a balanced outcome, work in the ADP must result in a decision that captures agreed next steps and provides political momentum for adopting an agreement in 2015. Switzerland, on behalf of the EIG, said a future agreement must be legally-binding, have global application, recognize differentiation and contain comparable and transparent targets.
405	2012	enb12563e	['Canada', 'Switzerland', 'United States']	The US, CANADA, AUSTRALIA and NEW ZEALAND emphasized the importance of recognizing progress made under the AWG-LCA, including the various new institutional arrangements established.

Several developed countries emphasized that discussions on issues, including adaptation and finance, will continue under other processes after the termination of the AWG-LCA. The EU drew attention, inter alia, to: the Adaptation Committee and the Standing Committee; and work on long-term finance and national adaptation plans. BARBADOS emphasized that there is no process outside the AWG-LCA to consider the post-2012 financing gap and that the Green Climate Fund remains “an empty shell.”
272	2013	enb12593e	['Canada']	On the nature of commitments, the EU and the REPUBLIC OF KOREA suggested reference to “commitments,” not “contributions.” With AFGHANISTAN, the Philippines, for the LMDCs, supported changing references to “contributions” to “commitments” noting that the former is not in the Convention.

CANADA added that these would be “initial commitments” until they are legally inscribed. The MARSHALL ISLANDS highlighted commitments in areas other than mitigation; cautioned against the insertion of “nationally-determined” as this would prejudge the international process; and proposed referring to “indicative” or “proposed” commitments as a compromise.
258	2013	enb12585e	['Iceland']	In the discussions, the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES called for further in-session workshops and events.

645	2014	enb12610e	['Norway', 'United States', 'United Kingdom']	Methodological Guidance on REDD+: An afternoon contact group, chaired by Stephen Cornelius (UK) and Robert Bamfo (Ghana), focused on consideration of the need for further guidance on safeguards. Many, including Ghana, for the AFRICAN GROUP, GUYANA, Panama, for the CfRN, INDIA, FIJI, INDONESIA, BRAZIL and CHINA, stressed that additional guidance on safeguards is premature. The EU, with the US and NORWAY, proposed that the Co-Chairs work on specific decision language for consideration by the group.
286	2014	enb12614e	['United States']	The US, with JAPAN, favored recognizing that contributions are nationally determined and reflect national circumstances. The MARSHALL ISLANDS, with the EU and CHILE, preferred “pledges” to “contributions.”
759	2014	enb12617e	['Belarus']	On a paragraph urging all parties to the Kyoto Protocol to ratify and implement the Doha Amendment, BELARUS suggested “calling upon” parties to consider the “possibility” of ratifying the Amendment and to “clarify all existing ambiguities that might hamper its implementation.” The EU said issues around Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8 (methodological issues under the Protocol) should first be resolved.
234	2014	enb12609e	['United States']	The EU said it expects Lima to make progress toward the adoption of a new global climate agreement in Paris, noting the group’s proposed 40% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 relative to 1990 levels announced in October. He welcomed the IPCC AR5 SYR and the outcome of the initial capitalization of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), totaling US$9.7 billion.
235	2014	enb12609e	['United States']	Yet, while many took off their jackets following the COP President’s exhortation, one observer lamented that “the generic opening statements did not signal that delegates were ready to roll up their sleeves.” Some participants suggested that Lima’s success will hinge on the “long overdue fulfillment of promised leadership roles,” with others pointing to “positive signals” of emission reduction or limitation targets announced by the EU, the US and China, and the pledges of US$9.7 billion for the GCF. “The heat is on,” said a long-time observer, “we’ll see if these signals will restore trust and facilitate progress toward an agreement in Paris over the next two weeks.”
240	2014	enb12611e	['Russia']	COP 20 President Pulgar-Vidal proposed establishing a contact group. SAUDI ARABIA, the EU, INDIA, IRAQ and CHINA, opposed by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, preferred informal consultations. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION introduced a draft decision (FCCC/CP/2014/CRP.1), noting the critical juncture of the negotiations in the lead-up to Paris. Interested parties will consult informally on how to move forward.
241	2014	enb12611e	['Norway']	EGYPT sought clarity on the scale of finance and supported quantified targets for finance to ensure predictability. NORWAY, the EU and JAPAN opposed an ex ante process to commit to quantified support commensurate with the ambition reflected in the adaptation and mitigation goals, with the EU signaling this as “a red line.” COLOMBIA emphasized the need to capture predictability in the new agreement.
282	2014	enb12614e	['Monaco']	The EU, with Monaco, for the EIG, indicated readiness to move forward on REDD+, markets and clarification of methodologies applicable to the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, regretting lack of agreement on these issues.
22	2014	enb12612e	['Russia', 'United States']	On review, the EU called for a commitment cycle of 10 years and, supported by the US, for a five-year cycle of review and revision. The EU said this should be elaborated further in the text. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION cautioned that a review process in the middle of the commitment period could make ratification challenging, as legislators require a clear understanding of what they are agreeing to.
285	2014	enb12614e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	Opposed by the EU and the US, MEXICO, with BANGLADESH, supported conducting, and offered to host, regional and sub-regional TEMs, with BRAZIL willing to explore this idea. Citing financial implications, SWITZERLAND said such TEMs should be held back-to-back with other meetings.
20	2014	enb12612e	['United States']	The EU said text should reflect that all parties will eventually take quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets. The US called for an option in the text to update the Convention’s annexes to reflect parties’ changing economic and emissions trends.
23	2014	enb12612e	['Switzerland']	The EU and SWITZERLAND supported describing the purpose of MOI. JAPAN said parties who provide and receive support should work together to mobilize private finance.
273	2015	enb12661e	['United States']	On support for the NAP process through contributions to the LDCF and the Special Climate Change Fund, CHINA, supported by INDIA and MALAYSIA, proposed deleting language inviting “parties that may make voluntary financial contributions” to provide such support. The EU, with JAPAN and the US, suggested deletion of the whole paragraph if it lacks agreement. Zambia, for the LDCs, opposed.
676	2015	enb12663e	['United Kingdom']	He announced four informal ministerial consultations, referred to as indabas, that would convene under the Comité, on: support, facilitated by Emmanuel Issoze-Ngondet (Gabon) and Jochen Flasbarth (Germany); differentiation in the context of mitigation, transparency and finance, including pre-2020 finance, facilitated by Izabella Teixeira (Brazil) and Vivian Balakrishnan (Singapore); and ambition, long-term objectives and periodic review, facilitated by Pa Ousman (The Gambia) and Amber Rudd (UK).
677	2015	enb12663e	['Canada', 'Switzerland']	On Monday, 7 December, COP President Fabius announced additional indabas on: adaptation, and loss and damage, led by René Orellana (Bolivia) and Åsa Romson (Sweden); cooperative approaches and mechanisms, led by Catherine McKenna (Canada) and Raymond Tshibanda N’Tungamulongo (Democratic Republic of the Congo); and forests, led by Daniel Vicente Ortega Pacheco (Ecuador), Doris Leuthard (Switzerland) and Henri Djombo (Republic of the Congo). He also announced a working group on response measures, led by Jan Szyszko (Poland) and Khaled Mohamed Fahmy Abdelall (Egypt) and an indaba on the preamble, led by Claudia Salerno (Venezuela), and on facilitating implementation and compliance, led by Rafael Pacchiano (Mexico).
671	2015	enb12663e	['United States']	On Thursday, 3 December, in the contact group, the EU, Colombia for AILAC, the US, and others said that the INDCs imply self-differentiation. The EU stated all countries should seek economy-wide targets but there should not be shared timelines. The US added that developing countries should be eligible for support in implementing their contributions, and LDCs and others should have flexibility to submit at their discretion without expectation. Japan stated that only vulnerable countries should have “partly conditional” INDCs.
680	2015	enb12663e	['Norway']	REPORT OF THE ADAPTATION FUND BOARD: This item (FCCC/KP/CMP/2015/2) was first considered on Wednesday, 2 December. Adaptation Fund Board Chair Hans Olav Ibrekk (Norway) reported that the “fund has never been more in demand” and has delivered effectively on its mandate, but that the sustainability of the Fund is “in danger.” Parties established a contact group co-chaired by Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) and Herman Sips (the Netherlands).
670	2015	enb12663e	['Norway', 'Switzerland', 'United States']	ADP Co-Chair Daniel Reifsnyder (US) highlighted informal notes on workstream 1 (the 2015 Agreement) and workstream 2 (pre-2020 ambition) (ADP.2015.10-11.InformalNote), and a technical paper produced by the Secretariat identifying closely related concepts, duplications and areas for streamlining (ADP.2015.12.InformalNote). Outlining the mode of work, he said the open-ended contact group would review progress made by spin-off groups and allow for coherence on cross cutting issues. He said that spin-off groups would address: preamble and purpose/general (draft Article 2 and 2bis), co-facilitated by George Wamukoya (Kenya) and Diann Black-Layne (Antigua and Barbuda); mitigation (draft Article 3, 3bis and 3ter), co-facilitated by Franz Perrez (Switzerland) and Fook Seng Kwok (Singapore); adaptation, and loss and damage (draft Articles 4 and 5) co-facilitated by Andrea Guerrero (Colombia) and Georg Børsting (Norway);finance (draft Article 6), co-facilitated by Georg Børsting (Norway) and Diann Black-Layne (Antigua and Barbuda); technology development and transfer (draft Article 7), co-facilitated by Tosi Mpanu-Mpanu (Democratic Republic of Congo) and Artur Runge-Metzger (EU); capacity building (draft Article 8), co-facilitated by Artur Runge-Metzger (EU) and Tosi Mpanu-Mpanu (Democratic Republic of Congo); transparency (draft Article 9), co-facilitated by Fook Seng Kwok (Singapore) and Franz Perrez (Switzerland); global stocktake (draft Article 10), co-facilitated by Roberto Dondisch (Mexico) and George Wamukoya (Kenya); implementation and compliance, and final clauses (draft Article 11 and Articles 12-26), co-facilitated by Sarah Baashan (Saudi Arabia) and Aya Yoshida (Japan); and workstream 2, co-facilitated by Aya Yoshida (Japan) and George Wamukoya (Kenya).
681	2015	enb12663e	['Norway']	REPORT ON THE HIGH-LEVEL MINISTERIAL ROUND TABLE ON INCREASED AMBITION OF KYOTO PROTOCOL COMMITMENTS: This item was first considered on Wednesday, 2 December. CMP Vice-President Sylla recalled there was no consensus on this issue at CMP 10 (FCCC/KP/CMP/2014/3). Saying that the high-level roundtable did not increase the ambition of Annex I parties, China, opposed by the EU, Australia and Norway, proposed a contact group. Parties agreed to informal consultations on a way forward facilitated by Paul Watkinson (France).
672	2015	enb12663e	['United States']	On Friday, 4 December, the EU, supported by Colombia for AILAC, Maldives for the Alliance of Small Islands States (AOSIS), and the US called for clarifying the date for the submission of contributions. Nicaragua and Bolivia called for Mother Earth to be reinserted in the text. Bolivia, with Venezuela, urged the inclusion of non-market mechanisms.
673	2015	enb12663e	['Canada', 'United States']	On the cluster of paragraphs related to cooperation, a group of developing country parties, supported by a developed country party, underlined the importance of strengthening institutional arrangements, and another noted a proposal to create a technical and knowledge platform. The US, EU and Canada suggested that the paragraph on the adequacy of support could be in decision text or the global stocktake.
540	2015	enb12654e	['United States']	TUVALU proposed adding language stating that the new agreement was being adopted in the context of Convention Article 17 (protocols). SAUDI ARABIA, the EU and the US opposed. Co-Chair Djoghlaf suggested discussing the issue during lunchtime.
274	2015	enb12652e	['United States']	PRE-COP: Over 60 ministers convened at the Pre-COP meeting in Paris, France, from 8-10 November 2015, to explore possible compromises, generate political momentum and prepare for resumption of negotiations at COP 21. The meeting was organized around four themes: equity and differentiation; ambition; post-2020 financing; and pre-2020 action and support. According to the incoming COP 21/CMP 11 Presidency’s press release, the meeting found: common determination to reach a universal agreement; large consensus on periodic review of national contributions and regular presentation of new contributions; a consensus on “no backtracking”; increased support for a single system, with flexibility depending on capability, with regard to fairness; positive signals for new financial announcements during COP 21 to achieve the US$100 billion goal; and strong support for continuation of the Lima Paris Action Agenda launched by the COP 20/CMP 10 Presidency in 2014.
358	2015	enb12657e	['United States']	On mitigation (Article 3), the EU, supported by Colombia, for AILAC, Maldives, for AOSIS, and the US called for clarifying the date for the submission of contributions. NICARAGUA and BOLIVIA called for Mother Earth to be reinserted in the text.
682	2015	enb12663e	['United States']	On Friday, 4 December, several parties expressed willingness to further engage constructively on this item under the COP. The US, Australia and Japan raised concerns about the process by which the draft conclusions were reached. Swaziland, supported by The Gambia, noted the draft text “provides a landing ground and marks the beginning of defining capacity building.” The EU understood the need to strengthen capacity-building institutions under the Convention as “our common vision” and hoped for the establishment of a capacity-building committee as an outcome of COP 21. Senegal, for the LDCs, with the Philippines, thanked the EU for their positive spirit that had allowed capacity building to be taken up at a higher level. Burundi lamented that “the text is still bracketed” and emphasized capacity building as necessary for her country to adapt to climate change impacts.
678	2015	enb12663e	['Russia', 'Norway']	Election of Officers Other Than the President: On Tuesday, 1 December, COP 21 President Fabius said that consultations on the election of officers would be conducted. On Thursday, 10 December, the COP elected members of the COP Bureau: SBSTA Chair Carlos Fuller (Belize); SBI Chair Tomasz Chruszczow (Poland); COP Rapporteur Georg Børsting (Norway); Ismail El Gizouli (Sudan); Hakima El Haite (Morocco); Khalid Abuleif (Saudi Arabia); Ravi Shanker Prasad (India); Oleg Shamanov (Russian Federation); Walter Schuldt-Espinel (Ecuador); and Colin Beck (Solomon Islands).
675	2015	enb12663e	['United States']	On Thursday, 3 December, the LDCs opposed a one-size-fits-all approach to reporting. The EU, Colombia for AILAC, the US, and others supported a common framework, with flexibility regarding the timing and detail in the reporting, and with support to developing countries.
357	2015	enb12657e	['United States']	After TUVALU, the US, the EU, VENEZUELA, CUBA and COLOMBIA expressed general support for using the compilation text with bridging proposals in line with the LMDCs’ proposal, parties began indicating key elements of concern.
679	2015	enb12663e	['United States']	On support for the NAP process through contributions to the LDCF and the Special Climate Change Fund, China, supported by India and Malaysia, proposed deleting language inviting “parties that may make voluntary financial contributions” to provide such support. China explained its preference for South-South cooperation. The EU, with Japan and the US, suggested deletion of the entire paragraph if it lacks agreement. Stressing the importance of the paragraph, Zambia, for the LDCs, called for retaining the paragraph.
740	2015	enb12656e	['United States']	On a facilitative dialogue, several parties proposed a wider scope, beyond mitigation. The EU expressed flexibility on this, suggesting referring to the purpose of the agreement. CHINA and SAUDI ARABIA expressed concern that a facilitative dialogue could represent an ex ante review and opposed this. The EU and the US said a dialogue would inform the next round of INDCs.
674	2015	enb12663e	['United States']	During discussions in the contact group, parties discussed the MRV of information provided by parties, several parties proposed a wider scope for facilitative dialogue that would go beyond mitigation. The EU expressed flexibility on this, suggesting referring to the purpose of the agreement. China and Saudi Arabia expressed concern that a facilitative dialogue could represent an ex ante review and opposed this. The EU and the US said a dialogue would inform the next round of INDCs.
1	2015	enb12655e	['Norway']	REPORT OF THE ADAPTATION FUND BOARD: Adaptation Fund Board Chair Hans Olav Ibrekk (Norway) reported that the “fund has never been more in demand” and has delivered effectively on its mandate, but that the sustainability of the fund is “in danger.” Parties established a contact group co-chaired by Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) and Herman Sips (the Netherlands) on this item (FCCC/KP/CMP/2015/2).
4	2015	enb12655e	['Norway']	The EU and Sudan, for the AFRICAN GROUP, supported the proposal to address cross-cutting issues in the contact group. NORWAY suggested that the ADP Co-Chairs prepare a reflection note for the Presidency, which the G-77/CHINA opposed at this time.
221	2015	enb12659e	['Canada']	COP 21 President Fabius recalled the agreed method of work, announcing additional consultation processes to begin on: adaptation, and loss and damage, led by René Orellana (Bolivia) and Åsa Romson (Sweden); cooperative mechanisms, led by Catherine McKenna (Canada) and a co-facilitator yet to be announced; and forests, led by Daniel Vicente Ortega Pacheco (Ecuador) and a co-facilitator yet to be announced. He also announced a working group on response measures. The co-facilitators then reported on their consultations during Sunday, 6 December and Monday, 7 December.
222	2015	enb12659e	['Switzerland']	Parties also discussed a paragraph on requesting recommendations from the JISC for SBI 44’s consideration in the context of the review of the JI guidelines. The EU, SWITZERLAND and JAPAN reformulated the paragraph, and parties agreed to reflect that recommendations presented by the JISC will present options to address concerns raised by stakeholders and for validation by an accredited independent entity of post-registration changes. Parties expressed their common understanding that such validation could include public commenting periods.
742	2015	enb12656e	['United States']	On finance, the EU, NEW ZEALAND and the US stated developed countries should meet their obligations, and that others in a position to do so should contribute. AILAC envisioned CBDR and respective capabilities (CBDRRC) and developed country parties and countries “willing to do so” providing support. The LMDCs underlined that finance should be from developed to developing countries.
2	2015	enb12655e	['Norway']	REPORT ON THE HIGH-LEVEL MINISTERIAL ROUNDTABLE ON INCREASED AMBITION OF KYOTO PROTOCOL COMMITMENTS: CMP Vice-President Sylla recalled there was no consensus on this issue at CMP 10 (FCCC/KP/CMP/2014/3). Saying that the high-level roundtable did not increase the ambition of Annex I parties, CHINA, opposed by the EU, AUSTRALIA and NORWAY, proposed a contact group. Parties agreed to informal consultations on a way forward facilitated by Paul Watkinson (France).
5	2015	enb12655e	['United States']	CONTACT GROUPS: Forum and Work Programme on Response Measures (SBI/SBSTA): SBI Chair Amena Yauvoli and SBSTA Chair Lidia Wojtal opened the contact group, co-facilitated by Delano Verwey (the Netherlands) and Eduardo Calvo (Peru), which considered draft decision text. The US said the text needed further consideration and that, because of ongoing negotiations under the ADP, the US would not be “in a position to adopt the decision text.”
744	2015	enb12656e	['Norway', 'Turkey']	In the evening, Co-Chair Reifsnyder proposed, on the mode of work, concluding the work of the spin-off groups and producing a new Co-Chairs’ compilation text that both brings together progress made and provides bridging proposals developed in consultations with spin-off group co-facilitators, to be considered by the contact group on Friday, 4 December. This was supported by the EU, NORWAY and TURKEY.
745	2015	enb12656e	['United States']	The EU emphasized that his commitment to mobilize climate finance would continue after 2020 and the US$100 billion commitment could be scaled up with an expansion of the donor base.
741	2015	enb12656e	['United States']	On mitigation, the EU, Colombia, for AILAC, the US and others said that the INDCs imply self-differentiation. The EU stated all countries should seek economy-wide targets but there should not be shared timelines. The US added that developing countries should be eligible for support in implementing their contributions, and that LDCs and others should have flexibility to submit at their discretion without expectation. JAPAN stated that only vulnerable countries should have “partly conditional” INDCs.
0	2015	enb12655e	['Russia']	CONSIDERATION OF PROPOSALS BY PARTIES FOR AMENDMENTS TO THE CONVENTION UNDER ARTICLE 15: Proposal by the Russian Federation: Parties agreed that Xavier Sticker (France) will conduct informal consultations (FCCC/CP/2011/5).
3	2015	enb12655e	['Norway', 'Switzerland', 'United States']	The EU and Switzerland, for the Environmental Integrity Group, supported the proposal for a compilation text. Guatemala, for AILAC, supported by NORWAY and the US, suggested asking facilitators to propose bridging text, which the G-77/CHINA suggested be captured in another document.
743	2015	enb12656e	['United States']	On transparency, the LDCs opposed a one-size-fits-all approach to reporting. The EU, AILAC, the US and others supported a common framework, with flexibility regarding the timing and detail in the reporting, and with support to developing countries.
252	2016	enb12682e	['Norway', 'United States']	On the way forward, many countries, including Tuvalu, for the LDCs, Mali, for the AFRICAN GROUP, NORWAY and the EU, proposed submissions for May 2017. A workshop was also proposed by many, including the US, and opposed by INDIA, who characterized workshops and submissions as premature. Participants suggested a technical or synthesis paper be prepared by the Secretariat based on party submissions or an outline by the co-facilitators.
640	2016	enb12681e	['Ukraine']	REPORT OF THE COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE: Compliance Committee Co-Chair Gerhard Loibl (Austria) presented the report, highlighting the Committee’s suggestion that the CMP consider ways for Ukraine to formally demonstrate its first commitment period compliance by requesting the Secretariat to make the necessary arrangements to enable the country to retire its units for compliance on an exceptional basis. Parties took note of the report and agreed to informal consultations.
250	2016	enb12682e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	The PHILIPPINES, the Bahamas, for the G-77/CHINA, Egypt, for the AFRICAN GROUP, and ARGENTINA reiterated that the question of mandating the Adaptation Fund to serve the Paris Agreement is procedural. AUSTRALIA, the EU, the US and Switzerland, for the EIG, highlighted that many issues require further consideration by the CMA before such a decision can be made.
633	2016	enb12689e	['Russia', 'Canada', 'United States']	Another lesson learned is that at times of uncertainty the world looks for leadership. At COP 7, amid the vacuum left by the US departure from the Kyoto Protocol, parties bent over backwards to facilitate ratifications by Canada, Japan and the Russian Federation, and lauded EU leadership. With another possible leadership vacuum emerging, many looked for signs of new leaders stepping forward. Some looked to the big players, namely China and the EU, to carry on the torch of climate action. Yet, as the COP concluded, others nominated themselves, including the Climate Vulnerable Forum’s 48 members who pledged to be 100% renewable by 2050. One observer suggested this was a sign of “leadership shifting to countries small in size and big in ambition.” Moving ahead, delegates will have to go, as expressed by Global Climate Champion Hakima El Haité, “further, faster, together” in order to complete their dual tasks of finalizing the rulebook while delivering on pre-2020 climate action.
50	2016	enb12686e	['United States']	Many delegates looking for inspiration found it in French President François Hollande’s affirmation that the Paris Agreement is “irreversible,” “inaction would be disastrous for the world” and that France would lead a dialogue with the US “with demands and determination.” Yet, a pragmatic delegate instead wanted ministers to “roll up their sleeves and sort out the Adaptation Fund’s future.”
693	2016	enb12685e	['United States']	On questions relating to linkages and context, NEW ZEALAND, the US, JAPAN and the EU advocated separating the context of the global stocktake from a question on increasing ambition.
251	2016	enb12682e	['Switzerland']	SWITZERLAND suggested these modalities would fall under discussions on biennial reports. The EU said the COP agenda item on the SCF is the most appropriate space to discuss communications of indicative support. Co-Chair Tyndall proposed that the Co-Chairs could highlight this issue, and parties’ differing views, in their report-back to the COP.
731	2016	enb12679e	['Turkey']	FRANCE reported on consultations held with all regional groups on the special circumstances facing Turkey, saying that many expressed a preference for bilateral consultations rather than a COP decision. Several groups supported consultations and opposed amending the agenda. TURKEY called for a clear COP decision.
249	2016	enb12682e	['United States']	On further technical work, a point of order was raised by Saudi Arabia, for the ARAB GROUP, supported by INDIA, and opposed by COLOMBIA, COSTA RICA, the EU and the US, that undertaking informal consultations on ways to have further informal discussions after the closing of the APA plenary was not within the contact group’s mandate. Co-Chair Baashan recognized the concern, saying the closing APA plenary will occur on Monday.
267	2016	enb12687e	['Canada']	On domestic steps, participants highlighted carbon pricing, REDD+ and capacity building. On cooperation, the EU and INDIA emphasized carbon markets. INDONESIA called for coordination among financial mechanisms, and MALDIVES urged facilitating access. INDIA stressed reducing technology barriers. CANADA highlighted the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.
304	2016	enb12684e	['Canada', 'Switzerland']	Switzerland, for the EIG, supported by AUSTRALIA, the EU, Costa Rica, for AILAC, the DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, MONGOLIA, ARGENTINA and CANADA, and opposed by Bolivia, for the LMDCs, and Maldives, for AOSIS, called for continuing work on the “rulebook” of the Paris Agreement in the second week. President Mezouar said he would take up this issue in the next Bureau meeting, scheduled for the afternoon.
305	2016	enb12684e	['Canada', 'United States', 'Norway']	Long-Term Climate Finance: During informal consultations, parties presented written submissions on a possible decision text by: the Philippines, for the G-77/CHINA; the EU; and CANADA, on behalf of Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Norway and the US.
306	2016	enb12684e	['Switzerland', 'Ukraine']	The EU, SWITZERLAND, CHINA and NEW ZEALAND supported noting the report. The EU stressed that virtual participation should count towards quorum at JISC meetings, while UKRAINE expressed concern, noting technical and time zone constraints. JAPAN warned against prejudging work undertaken on the creation of new mechanisms under the Paris Agreement. Discussions will continue.
527	2016	enb12688e	['United States']	Country representatives highlighted: the US$27 billion Dubai Green Fund; Hungary’s support to partner countries’ NDC implementation; and Germany’s Climate Action Plan 2050 and a new US$50 million contribution to the Adaptation Fund.
528	2016	enb12688e	['United States']	EGYPT, opposed by the US and EU, suggested that two paragraphs were repetitious: a paragraph welcoming developed countries’ progress toward the goal of mobilizing US$100 billion annually by 2020; and paragraph 1, welcoming submissions by developed countries in response to Decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 114 (enhanced provision of, inter alia, finance and a roadmap to US$100 billion). The Philippines, for the G-77/CHINA, and SAUDI ARABIA bracketed paragraph 1.
627	2016	enb12689e	['Canada']	On further work, the LMDCs and Arab Group proposed the development of a synthesis report on adaptation communications as a component of NDCs, based on submissions by parties. New Zealand opposed, suggesting the Secretariat synthesize parties’ submissions on this item around common themes. The EU and Canada supported requesting the Secretariat to develop a technical paper, containing a compilation of existing guidance on adaptation communications.
732	2016	enb12679e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	On session outcomes, several countries supported a draft decision. The EU and Switzerland, among others, stressed the need for clarity on the way forward to COP 24. The US enquired about other possible vehicles for capturing progress. Informal consultations will continue.
266	2016	enb12687e	['Canada']	On ambition, panelists discussed: success factors; immediate domestic steps; and cooperation mechanisms. On success factors, the EU stated it exceeded its Cancún mitigation pledge. INDONESIA and INDIA urged ratification of the Doha Amendment. CANADA underlined engaging non-state actors.
692	2016	enb12685e	['United States']	Parties considered whether to provide recommendations to the COP on how or where these matters could be taken up. BRAZIL, supported by the EU and US, suggested Article 4.10 (common timeframes) be housed in the SBI and Article 12 (education, training and public awareness) in the SBI or SBSTA.
632	2016	enb12689e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	On session outcomes, several countries supported a draft decision. The EU and Switzerland, among others, stressed the need for clarity on the way forward to COP 24. The US inquired about other possible vehicles for capturing progress.
265	2016	enb12687e	['United States']	The EU highlighted CMA 1 as a historic moment for “those of us who worked towards a universal climate deal and those living with the reality of climate change.” She described the Paris Agreement as a “game changer” and called for continued progress on its rulebook.
48	2016	enb12686e	['United States']	Highlighting his country’s commitment to lead by example, President François Hollande, France, stressed that the Paris Agreement is “irreversible,” noting governments, businesses, the financial sector, NGOs and citizens worldwide are undertaking initiatives and finding concrete solutions. He underscored that the US must respect its climate commitments, adding that France would lead a dialogue with the new US President with respect and determination. He stated that, “despite all our differences, what unites us is what we have in common, our planet.”
625	2016	enb12689e	['Norway', 'United States']	On linkages, many highlighted the global stocktake’s relevance. The G-77/China called for adaptation communications to inform the global stocktake while New Zealand reminded that adaptation communications are voluntary, and, therefore, could at best “contribute” to a meaningful global stocktake. Norway and others observed links with NAPs, which the Arab Group, said could be a starting point. The EU and US noted linkages with the transparency framework.
624	2016	enb12689e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	The Arab Group and Iran, opposed by the US and Switzerland, stressed the need to focus on the full scope of NDCs as defined in Paris Agreement Article 3 (NDCs, including progression and support). The LMDCs, opposed by the EU, proposed developing accounting guidance for technology and capacity-building support. Many agreed that Decision 1/CP.21 paragraph 31 (NDCs accounting guidance) provides the basis for developing guidance.
165	2016	enb12683e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	On quantified economy-wide targets by developed country parties, speakers from the EU, Switzerland, the US and Australia reported on progress toward their targets. All underlined the role of renewable energy and energy efficiency. The EU and Switzerland highlighted taxation measures and, with Australia, emissions trading. Participants queried the status of Doha Amendment ratifications and the future of the climate regime given the recent US election.

The European Union (EU) said the workshop should “help understanding the apparent gaps” in clarity. Canada noted submissions on strategies and approaches that can increase clarity. Parties’ views differed on whether to emphasize progress made or to highlight the adaptation finance gap. Some parties suggested focusing not only on needs but more specifically on how to: translate needs into projects; address and obtain access to finance for the identified projects; and realize enabling environments and policies to attract financial resources at the scale necessary to support those actions. Others stressed their opposition to referring to “bankable projects.”

296	2018	enb12740e	['Norway']	Views differed on the expected COP 24 outcome of the Talanoa Dialogue. Maldives, for AOSIS, called for a procedural decision and a political declaration that urges increased ambition for new and updated NDCs submitted in 2020. The EU said the outcome should contain a collective political commitment to look at the adequacy of, and the need to strengthen, ambition. Botswana, for the AFRICAN GROUP, suggested conclusions that acknowledge the process and call for raised ambition, and with NORWAY, suggested a process beyond COP 24.
774	2018	enb12737e	['United States']	On moving work under the forum forward, the EU suggested more focus on a just transition in the energy sector and on decent work in the agriculture sector.

297	2018	enb12740e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	Views strongly diverged regarding references to the key findings of the SCF’s 2018 Biennial Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows technical report. South Africa, for the AFRICAN GROUP, supported by INDIA, cautioned against “cherry picking” individual findings. Saudi Arabia, for the ARAB GROUP, opposed referring to the findings. The EU underscored the relevance of highlighting the continuous increase in climate finance flows, with the US adding the assessment’s findings were the result of a comprehensive exercise and adopted by consensus by the SCF. SWITZERLAND proposed to note the report with appreciation and move it to the annex.
543	2018	enb12739e	['Switzerland']	South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA, the EU, Solomon Islands, for AOSIS, Switzerland, for the EIG, and Malawi, for the LDCs, commended the work and role of the Adaptation Fund in supporting adaptation efforts in developing countries, with the G-77/CHINA also appreciating the Fund’s “innovativeness” in the area of access modalities.

360	2019	enb12775e	['Switzerland', 'United States']	Many parties clarified that any informal note should take into account the diversity of views. Co-Chair Xiang invoked the possibility of intersessional work, with the EU, Australia, the US, Saint Kitts and Nevis for AOSIS, and Switzerland for EIG supporting; and Saudi Arabia for the Arab Group, China, and Egypt objecting.
364	2019	enb12775e	['Norway']	In the contact group, Palestine, for the G-77/China, highlighted, inter alia: inconsistencies in reporting on the GCF’s first replenishment (GCF-1); the need for information about actual disbursements; and concerns around delays in accreditation and politicization of project eligibility decisions. Antigua and Barbuda, for AOSIS, called for the GCF to incorporate a strategic direction addressing loss and damage and to establish an emergency response window. Malawi, for the LDCs, with several others, stressed the need for streamlined processes for accreditation, particularly for Direct Access Entities. South Africa for the African Group, the EU, Japan, and Norway, among others, called for welcoming GCF-1, in particular contributions by countries that doubled their pledges. Many developing countries underscored the insufficiency of contributions. Iran called for not discriminating against any projects, in particular those with a carbon capture and storage component.
119	2019	enb12766e	['Norway', 'United Kingdom']	Long-term climate finance: Contact group Co-Chairs Rob Moore (UK) and Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) invited views on work done so far and on elements that should be captured in a COP decision text. Palestine, for the G-77/CHINA, stressing long-term finance is a critical issue and “not a two-year matter,” called for a forum for discussing climate finance from a strategic perspective. NORWAY cautioned against duplicating work, given the biennial finance communications due from developed countries starting in 2020. Belize, for AOSIS, and Colombia, for AILAC, called for assessing the achievement of the 2020 finance goal and stressing the importance of adaptation finance. The EU, opposed by South Africa, for the AFRICAN GROUP, saw no reason to extend discussions under the long-term finance item beyond 2020. Discussions will continue in informal consultations.
368	2019	enb12775e	['United States']	On top of all this, the often unspoken, but still looming, aspect beyond 2020 is the imminent US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. Taking effect in eleven months, less than a week before COP 26, the repercussions were already being felt. Many expressed anger that the future defector attempted to wield its influence in writing the rules for Article 6 and loss and damage—rules that the US will not be subject to unless it rejoins the Agreement. Delegates also wondered about the future credibility of the Paris Agreement. As with the Kyoto Protocol before it, there will again be a climate agreement, one designed around US demands, without the participation of the world’s highest per capita emitter. This raised questions of leadership, and serious concerns if the EU, hampered internally by some member states reluctant to engage on climate, or China, focused on its own development, can credibly lead the way to a more climate ambitious future.

The EU saw no reason to extend discussions under the long-term finance item beyond 2020. Norway cautioned against duplicating work, given the biennial finance communications due from developed countries starting in 2020.
